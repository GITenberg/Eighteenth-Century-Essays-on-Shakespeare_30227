<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The purpose of this book is to give an account of
Shakespeare's reputation during the eighteenth century,
and to suggest that there are grounds for reconsidering
the common opinion that the century did not give him
his due. The nine Essays or Prefaces here reprinted
may claim to represent the chief phases of Shakespearian
study from the days of Dryden to those of Coleridge.
It is one of the evils following in the train of the romantic
revival that the judgments of the older school have been
discredited or forgotten. The present volume shows
that the eighteenth century knew many things which
the nineteenth has rediscovered for itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is at least eighty years since most of these essays
were reprinted. Rowe's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account of Shakespeare</span></span> is given
in its original and complete form for the first time, it
is believed, since 1714; what was printed in the early
Variorum editions, and previously in almost every edition
since 1725, was Pope's version of Rowe's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account</span></span>.
Dennis's Essay has not appeared since the author republished
it in 1721. In all cases the texts have been
collated with the originals; and the more important
changes in the editions published in the lifetime of the
author are indicated in the Introduction or Notes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Introduction has been planned to show the
main lines in the development of Shakespeare's reputation,
and to prove that the new criticism, which is said
to begin with Coleridge, takes its rise as early as the
third quarter of the eighteenth century. On the question
of Theobald's qualifications as an editor, it would appear
that we must subscribe to the deliberate verdict of
Johnson. We require strong evidence before we may
disregard contemporary opinion, and in Theobald's case
there is abundant evidence to confirm Johnson's view.
Johnson's own edition, on the other hand, has not received
justice during the last century.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The early nineteenth century was too readily convinced
by Coleridge and Hazlitt that they were the first to
recognise and to explain the greatness of Shakespeare.
If amends have recently been made to the literary ideals
of Pope and Johnson, the reaction has not yet extended
to Shakespearian criticism. Are we not still inclined to
hold the verdicts of Hume and Chesterfield as representative
of eighteenth-century opinion, and to find
proof of a lack of appreciation in the editorial travesties
of the playhouse? To this century, as much as to the
nineteenth, Shakespeare was the glory of English letters.
So Pope and Johnson had stated in unequivocal language,
which should not have been forgotten. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is not so
much an imitator as an instrument of Nature,”</span> said
Pope, <span class="tei tei-q">“and 'tis not so just to say that he speaks from
her as that she speaks through him”</span>; and Johnson
declared that <span class="tei tei-q">“the stream of time, which is continually
washing the dissoluble fabrics of other poets, passes without
injury by the adamant of Shakespeare.”</span> But Pope
and Johnson had ventured to point out, in the honesty
of their criticism, that Shakespeare was not free from
faults; and it was this which the nineteenth century
chose to remark. Johnson's Preface in particular was
remembered only to be despised. It is not rash to say
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that at the present time the majority of those who chance
to speak of it pronounce it a discreditable performance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This false attitude to the eighteenth century had
its nemesis in the belief that we were awakened by
foreigners to the greatness of Shakespeare. Even one so
eminently sane as Hazlitt lent support to this opinion.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We will confess,”</span> says the Preface to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Characters of
Shakespeare's Plays</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“that some little jealousy of the
character of the national understanding was not without
its share in producing the following undertaking, for we
were piqued that it should be reserved for a foreign critic
to give reasons for the faith which we English have in
Shakespeare”</span>; and the whole Preface resolves itself,
however reluctantly, into praise of Schlegel and censure
of Johnson. When a thorough Englishman writes thus,
it is not surprising that Germany should have claimed to
be the first to give Shakespeare his true place. The
heresy has been exposed; but even the slightest investigation
of eighteenth-century opinion, or the mere
recollection of what Dryden had said, should have prevented
its rise. Though Hazlitt took upon himself the
defence of the national intelligence, he incorporated in
his Preface a long passage from Schlegel, because, in his
opinion, no English critic had shown like enthusiasm or
philosophical acuteness. We cannot regret the delusion
if we owe to it the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Characters of Shakespeare's Plays</span></span>,
but his patriotic task would have been easier, and might
even have appeared unnecessary, had he known that many
of Schlegel's acute and enthusiastic observations had been
anticipated at home.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even those who are willing to give the eighteenth
century its due have not recognised how it appreciated
Shakespeare. At no time in this century was he not
popular. The author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esmond</span></span> tells us that Shakespeare
was quite out of fashion until Steele brought him
back into the mode.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> Theatrical records would alone
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be sufficient to show that the ascription of this honour to
Steele is an injustice to his contemporaries. In the year
that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tatler</span></span> was begun, Rowe brought out his edition
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“best of our poets”</span>; and a reissue was called for
five years later. It is said by Johnson<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> that Pope's
edition drew the public attention to Shakespeare's works,
which, though often mentioned, had been little read.
Henceforward there was certainly an increase in the
number of critical investigations, but if Shakespeare had
been little read, how are we to explain the coffee-house
discussions of which we seem to catch echoes in the
periodical literature? The allusions in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span>, or
the essays in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Censor</span></span>, must have been addressed to a
public which knew him. Dennis, who <span class="tei tei-q">“read him over
and over and still remained unsatiated,”</span> tells how he was
accused, by blind admirers of the poet, of lack of veneration,
because he had ventured to criticise, and how he
had appealed from a private discussion to the judgment
of the public. <span class="tei tei-q">“Above all I am pleased,”</span> says the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“in observing that the Tragedies of Shakespeare,
which in my youthful days have so frequently
filled my eyes with tears, hold their rank still, and are the
great support of our theatre.”</span><a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> Theobald
could say that <span class="tei tei-q">“this author is grown so universal a
book that there are very few studies or collections of
books, though small, amongst which it does not hold a
place”</span>; and he could add that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is scarce a poet
that our English tongue boasts of who is more the
subject of the Ladies' reading.”</span><a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> It would be difficult
to explain away these statements. The critical interest in
Shakespeare occasioned by Pope's edition may have
increased the knowledge of him, but he had been regularly
cited, long before Pope's day, as England's representative
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
genius. To argue that he had ever been out of favour
we must rely on later statements, and they are presumably
less trustworthy than those which are contemporary.
Lyttelton remarked that a veneration for Shakespeare
seems to be a part of the national religion, and the only part in
which even men of sense are fanatics;<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> and
Gibbon spoke of the <span class="tei tei-q">“idolatry for the gigantic genius
of Shakespeare, which is inculcated from our infancy as
the first duty of an Englishman.”</span><a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> The present volume
will show how the eighteenth century could almost lose
itself in panegyric of Shakespeare. The evidence is so
overwhelming that it is hard to understand how the
century's respect for Shakespeare was ever doubted.
When Tom Jones took Partridge to the gallery of
Drury Lane, the play was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>. The fashionable
topics on which Mr. Thornhill's friends from town
would talk, to the embarrassment of the Primroses
and the Flamboroughs, were <span class="tei tei-q">“pictures, taste, Shakespeare,
and the musical glasses.”</span> The greatest poet of
the century played a leading part in erecting the statue
in the Poets' Corner. And it was an eighteenth-century
actor who instituted the Stratford celebrations.
</p>

During the entire century Shakespeare dominated the
stage. He was more to the actor then, and more familiar
to the theatre-goer, than he is now. It is true that from
Betterton's days to Garrick's, and later, his plays were
commonly acted from mangled versions. But these
versions were of two distinct types. The one respected
the rules of the classical drama, the other indulged the
license of pantomime. The one was the labour of the
pedant theorist, the other was rather the improvisation
of the theatre manager. And if the former were truly
representative of the taste of the century, as has sometimes
been implied, it has to be explained how they
were not so popular as the latter. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our taste has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id="Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gone back a whole century,”</span> says the strolling player
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicar of Wakefield</span></span>,<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and
all the plays of Shakespeare are the only things that
go down.”</span> The whole passage is a satire on Garrick<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
and a gibe at Drury Lane: <span class="tei tei-q">“The public go only to
be amused, and find themselves happy when they can
enjoy a pantomime under the sanction of Jonson's or
Shakespeare's name.”</span> But, whatever was done with
Shakespeare's plays, they were the very life of the
theatre. When we remember also the number of
editions which were published, and the controversies
to which they gave rise, as well as the fact that the
two literary dictators were among his editors, we are
prompted to ask, What century has felt the influence
of Shakespeare more than the eighteenth?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The century's interest in Shakespeare shows itself in
four main phases. The first deals with his neglect of
the so-called rules of the drama; the second determines
what was the extent of his learning; the third considers
the treatment of his text; and the fourth, more purely
aesthetic, shows his value as a delineator of character.
The following remarks take these questions in order;
and a concluding section gives an account of the individual
essays here reprinted. Though the phases are
closely connected and overlap to some extent, the order
in which they are here treated accords in the main with
their chronological sequence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dryden is the father of Shakespearian criticism.
Though he disguised his veneration at times, he expressed
his true faith when he wrote, deliberately, the fervent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
estimate in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay of Dramatic Poesy</span></span>. Johnson saw
that Pope had expanded it, and his own experience made
him say that the editors and admirers of Shakespeare, in
all their emulation of reverence, had not done much more
than diffuse and paraphrase this <span class="tei tei-q">“epitome of excellence.”</span>
But concurrently on to Johnson's time we can trace the
influence of Thomas Rymer, who, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Short View of
Tragedy</span></span>, had championed the classical drama, and had
gone as far in abuse as his greater contemporary had gone
in praise. The authority which each exerted is well
illustrated by Rowe's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account of Shakespeare</span></span>. Rowe is of
the party of Dryden, but he cannot refrain from replying
to Rymer, though he has resolved to enter into no critical
controversy. He says he will not inquire into the justness
of Rymer's remarks, and yet he replies to him in two
passages. That these were silently omitted by Pope when
he included the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account of Shakespeare</span></span> in his own edition
in 1725 does not mean that Rymer was already being
forgotten. We know from other sources that Pope rated
his abilities very highly. But the condensed form in
which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account</span></span> was regularly reprinted does not convey
so plainly as the original the influence of the rival schools
at the beginning of the eighteenth century. In addition
to the passages on Rymer, Pope omitted several valuable
allusions to Dryden. The influence of Dryden, however,
is plain enough. He seems to have been ever present to
Rowe, suggesting ideas to be accepted or refuted. Rowe
must have been indebted to the conversation of Dryden
as well as to the researches of Betterton.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rowe's own dramatic work is an interesting comment
on the critical portions of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account of Shakespeare</span></span>.
When he professes to have taken Shakespeare as his
model,<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a name="Pgxv" id="Pgxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which shows that his editorial work had taught him
the trick of an occasional line contrary to the normal
rules of blank verse. Notwithstanding a brave prologue,
he was not able to shake himself free from the rules,
which tightened their grip on English tragedy till they
choked it. His regard for Shakespeare did not give him
courage for the addition of a comic element or an underplot.
He must obey the <span class="tei tei-q">“hampering critics,”</span> though
his avowed model had ignored them. Accordingly, in
his more deliberate prose criticism we find, amid his
veneration of Shakespeare, his regard for the rules of the
classical drama. The faults of Shakespeare, we read,
were not so much his own as those of his time, for
<span class="tei tei-q">“tragi-comedy was the common mistake of that age,”</span>
and there was as yet no definite knowledge of how a
play should be constructed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The burden of Rowe's criticism is that <span class="tei tei-q">“strength and
nature made amends for art.”</span> The line might serve
as the text of many of the early appreciations of
Shakespeare. Though the critics all resented Rymer's
treatment of the poet, some of them stood by his
doctrines. They might appease this resentment by protesting
against his manners or refuting his plea for a
dramatic chorus; but on the whole they recognised the
claims of the classical models. The more the dramatic
fervour failed, the more the professed critics counselled
observance of the rules. In 1702 Farquhar had pleaded
for the freedom of the English stage in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Discourse upon
Comedy</span></span>, but his arguments were unavailing. The duller
men found it easier to support the rigid doctrines, which
had been fully expounded by the French critics. The
seventh or supplementary volume of Rowe's edition of
Shakespeare was introduced by Charles Gildon's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
the Art, Rise, and Progress of the Stage in Greece, Rome, and
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvi">[pg xvi]</span><a name="Pgxvi" id="Pgxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
England</span></span>, which, as the title shows, was a laboured
exposition of the classical doctrines. Gildon had begun
as an enemy of Rymer. In 1694 he had published <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Some
Reflections on Mr. Rymer's Short View of Tragedy and an
Attempt at a Vindication of Shakespeare</span></span>. Therein he had
spoken of <span class="tei tei-q">“noble irregularity,”</span> and censured the <span class="tei tei-q">“graver
pedants”</span> of the age. By 1710 he is a grave pedant
himself. In 1694 he had said that Rymer had scarce
produced one criticism that was not borrowed from the
French writers; in 1710 the remark is now applicable to
its author. Gildon's further descent as a critic is evident
eight years later in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Complete Art of Poetry</span></span>. He is now
a slave to the French doctrine of the rules. He confesses
himself the less ready to pardon the <span class="tei tei-q">“monstrous absurdities”</span>
of Shakespeare, as one or two plays, such as the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempest</span></span>, are <span class="tei tei-q">“very near a regularity.”</span> Yet he acknowledges
that Shakespeare abounds in beauties, and he makes
some reparation by including a long list of his finer
passages. Gildon was a man whose ideas took their
colour from his surroundings. In the days of his
acquaintanceship with Dryden he appreciated Shakespeare
more heartily than when he was left to the friendship of
Dennis or the favours of the Duke of Buckinghamshire.
His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art of Poetry</span></span> is a dishonest compilation, which owes
what value it has to the sprinkling of contemporary
allusions. It even incorporates, without any acknowledgment,
long passages from Sidney's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apologie</span></span>. We should
be tempted to believe that Gildon merely put his name to
a hack-work collection, were it not that there is a gradual
deterioration in his criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John Dennis also replied to Rymer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Short View</span></span>, and
was classed afterwards as one of Rymer's disciples.
In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Impartial Critick</span></span> (1693) he endeavoured to show
that the methods of the ancient Greek tragedy were
not all suitable to the modern English theatre. To
introduce a chorus, as Rymer had recommended, or to
expel love from the stage, would, he argued, only ruin
the English drama. But his belief in the classical rules
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvii">[pg xvii]</span><a name="Pgxvii" id="Pgxvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made him turn the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Merry Wives</span></span>
into the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comical Gallant</span></span>.
As he found in the original three actions, each independent
of the other, he had set himself to make the whole
<span class="tei tei-q">“depend on one common centre.”</span> In the Dedication to
the letters <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the Genius and Writings of Shakespeare</span></span> we
read that Aristotle, <span class="tei tei-q">“who may be call'd the Legislator of
Parnassus, wrote the laws of tragedy so exactly and so
truly in reason and nature that succeeding criticks have
writ justly and reasonably upon that art no farther than
they have adhered to their great master's notions.”</span> But
at the very beginning of the letters themselves he says
that <span class="tei tei-q">“Shakespeare was one of the greatest geniuses that
the world e'er saw.”</span> Notwithstanding his pronounced
classical taste, his sense of the greatness of Shakespeare is
as strong as Rowe's, and much stronger than Gildon's.
His writings prove him a man of competent scholarship,
who had thought out his literary doctrines for himself,
and could admire beauty in other than classical garb.
The result is that at many points his opinions are
at marked variance with those of Rymer, for whom,
however, he had much respect. Rymer, for instance, had
said that Shakespeare's genius lay in comedy, but the
main contention of Dennis's letters is that he had an
unequalled gift for tragedy. As a critic Dennis is
greatly superior to Rymer and his disciples. The
ancients guided his taste without blinding him to modern
excellence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even Lewis Theobald, whom some would consider
Shakespeare's greatest friend in this century, believed in
the rules. He complied with the taste of the town when
he wrote pantomimes, but he was a sterner man when he
posed as a critic. He would then speak of the <span class="tei tei-q">“general
absurdities of Shakespeare,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“errors”</span> in the
structure of his plays. He passed this criticism both in his
edition of Shakespeare and in the early articles in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Censor</span></span> on
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King Lear</span></span>, which are also of considerable
historical interest as being the first essays devoted
exclusively to an examination of a single Shakespearian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexviii">[pg xviii]</span><a name="Pgxviii" id="Pgxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
play. His complacent belief in the rules prompted
him to correct <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard II.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The many scattered beauties
which I have long admired,”</span> he says naïvely in the
Preface, <span class="tei tei-q">“induced me to think they would have stronger
charms if they were interwoven in a regular Fable.”</span> No
less confident is a note on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Love's Labours Lost</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Besides
the exact regularity of the rules of art, which the author
has happened to preserve in some few of his pieces, this is
demonstration, I think, that though he has more frequently
transgressed the unity of Time by cramming years
into the compass of a play, yet he knew the absurdity of
so doing, and was not unacquainted with the rule to the
contrary.”</span><a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>
Theobald was a critic of the same type as
Gildon. Each had profound respect for what he took
to be the accredited doctrines. If on certain points
Theobald's ideas were liable to change, the explanation is
that he was amenable to the opinions of others. We do
not find in Theobald's criticism the courage of originality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is little about the rules in Pope's Preface. That
Pope respected them cannot be doubted, else he would
not have spoken so well of Rymer, and in the critical
notes added to his Homer we should not hear so much of
Le Bossu's treatise on the Epic.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> But Pope was a
discreet man, who knew when to be silent. He regarded
it as a misfortune that Shakespeare was not so circumstanced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexix">[pg xix]</span><a name="Pgxix" id="Pgxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as to be able to write on the model of the
ancients, but, unlike the pedant theorists, he refused to
judge Shakespeare by the rules of a foreign drama.
Much the same is to be said of Addison. His belief in
the rules appears in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cato</span></span>. His over-rated criticism of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paradise Lost</span></span> is little more than a laboured application of
the system of Le Bossu. But in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span> he too
urges that Shakespeare is not to be judged according to
the rules. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our critics do not seem sensible,”</span> he writes,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that there is more beauty in the works of a great genius
who is ignorant of the rules of art than in those of a little
genius who knows and observes them. Our inimitable
Shakespeare is a stumbling-block to the whole tribe of
these rigid critics. Who would not rather read one of
his plays where there is not a single rule of the stage
observed, than any production of a modern critic where
there is not one of them violated?”</span><a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> The rigid critics
continued to find fault with the structure of Shakespeare's
plays. In the articles in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adventurer</span></span>
on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempest</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King Lear</span></span>, Joseph Warton repeats the standard objection
to tragi-comedy and underplots. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Biographia
Britannica</span></span> we still find it stated that Shakespeare set
himself to please the populace, and that the people <span class="tei tei-q">“had
no notion of the rules of writing, or the model of the
Ancients.”</span> But one whose tastes were classical, both by
nature and by training, had been thinking out the matter
for himself. It was only after long reflection, and with
much hesitation, that Johnson had disavowed what had
almost come to be considered the very substance of the
classical faith. In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irene</span></span> he had bowed to the rules;
he had, however, begun to suspect them by the time he
wrote the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rambler</span></span>, and in the Preface to his edition of
Shakespeare suspicion has become conviction. His sturdy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexx">[pg xx]</span><a name="Pgxx" id="Pgxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
common sense and independence of judgment led him to
anticipate much of what has been supposed to be the
discovery of the romantic school. His Preface has
received scant justice. There is no more convincing
criticism of the neo-classical doctrines.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Henceforward we hear less about the rules. Johnson
had performed a great service for that class of critics
whose deference to learned opinion kept them from saying
fully what they felt. The lesser men had not been at
their ease when they referred to Shakespeare. We see
their difficulty in the Latin lectures of Joseph Trapp,
the first Professor of Poetry at Oxford, as well as in the
Grub Street <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay upon English Tragedy</span></span> (1747) by
William Guthrie. They admire his genius, but they
persist in regretting that his plays are not properly
constructed. Little importance attaches to Mrs. Montagu's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare</span></span>
(1769).<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> It was only a well-meaning but shallow reply
to Voltaire,<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
and a reply was unnecessary. Johnson had
already vindicated the national pride in Shakespeare.
That his views soon became the commonplaces of those
critics who strike the average of current opinion, is shown
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxi">[pg xxi]</span><a name="Pgxxi" id="Pgxxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by such a work as William Cooke's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elements of Dramatic
Criticism</span></span> (1775). But traces of the school of Rymer are
still to be found, and nowhere more strongly than in the
anonymous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cursory Remarks on Tragedy</span></span> (1774). In this
little volume of essays the dramatic rules are defended
against the criticism of Johnson by a lame repetition of
the arguments which Johnson had overthrown. Even
Pope is said to have let his partiality get the better of his
usual justice and candour when he claimed that Shakespeare
was not to be judged by what were called the
rules of Aristotle. There are laws, this belated critic urges,
which bind each individual as a citizen of the world;
and once again we read that the rules of the classical
drama are in accordance with human reason. This
book is the last direct descendant of Rymer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Short
View</span></span>. The ancestral trait appears in the question whether
Shakespeare was in general even a good tragic writer.
But it is a degenerate descendant. If it has learned
good manners, it is unoriginal and dull; and it is so
negligible that it has apparently not been thought worth
while to settle the question of its authorship.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The discussion on Shakespeare's attitude to the dramatic
rules was closely connected with the long controversy on
the extent of his learning. The question naturally suggested
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxii">[pg xxii]</span><a name="Pgxxii" id="Pgxxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
itself how far his dramatic method was due to his
ignorance of the classics. Did he know the rules and
ignore them, or did he write with no knowledge of the
Greek and Roman models? Whichever view the critics
adopted, one and all felt they were arguing for the honour
of Shakespeare. If some would prove for his greater
glory that parallel passages were due to direct borrowing,
others held it was more to his credit to have known
nothing of the classics and to have equalled or surpassed
them by the mere force of unassisted genius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The controversy proper begins with Rowe's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account of
Shakespeare</span></span>. On this subject, as on others, Rowe expresses
the tradition of the seventeenth century. His
view is the same as Dryden's, and Dryden had accepted
Jonson's statement that Shakespeare had <span class="tei tei-q">“small Latin
and less Greek.”</span> Rowe believes that his acquaintance
with Latin authors was such as he might have gained at
school: he could remember tags of Horace or Mantuan,
but was unable to read Plautus in the original. The plea
that comparative ignorance of the classics may not have
been a disadvantage, as it perhaps prevented the sacrifice
of fancy to correctness, prompted a reply by Gildon in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on the Stage</span></span>, where the argument is based partly on
the belief that Shakespeare had read Ovid and Plautus
and had thereby neither spoiled his fancy nor confined his
genius. The question was probably at this time a common
topic of discussion. Dennis's abler remarks were suggested,
as he tells us, by conversation in which he
found himself opposed to the prevalent opinion. He
is more pronounced in his views than Rowe had been.
His main argument is that as Shakespeare is deficient
in the <span class="tei tei-q">“poetical art”</span> he could not but have been
ignorant of the classics, for, had he known them, he
could not have failed to profit by them. Dennis
is stirred even to treat the question as one affecting the
national honour. <span class="tei tei-q">“He who allows,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
Shakespeare had learning and a familiar acquaintance with
the Ancients, ought to be looked upon as a detractor from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiii">[pg xxiii]</span><a name="Pgxxiii" id="Pgxxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his extraordinary merit and from the glory of Great
Britain.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prominence of the controversy forced Pope to
refer to it in his Preface, but he had apparently little
interest in it. Every statement he makes is carefully
guarded: there are translations from Ovid, he says,
among the poems which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pass for</span></em> Shakespeare's; he will
not pretend to say in what language Shakespeare read
the Greek authors; Shakespeare <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appears</span></em> to have been
conversant in Plautus. He is glad of the opportunity
to reply to Dennis's criticism of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Julius
Caesar</span></span>, but though he praises the truthful representation
of the Roman spirit and manners, he discreetly refuses to
say how Shakespeare came to know of them. As he had
not thought out the matter for himself, he feared to tread
where the lesser men rushed in. But though he records
the evidence brought forward by those who believed in
Shakespeare's knowledge of the Ancients, he does not fail
to convey the impression that he belongs to the other
party. And, indeed, in another passage of the Preface he
says with definiteness, inconsistent with his other statements,
that Shakespeare was <span class="tei tei-q">“without assistance or advice
from the learned, as without the advantage of education or
acquaintance among them, without that knowledge of the
best models, the Ancients, to inspire him with an emulation
of them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the fifty years between Pope's Preface and
Johnson's, the controversy continued intermittently without
either party gaining ground. In the Preface to the
supplementary volume to Pope's edition—which is a
reprint of Gildon's supplementary volume to Rowe's—Sewell
declared he found evident marks through all
Shakespeare's writings of knowledge of the Latin tongue.
Theobald, who was bound to go astray when he ventured
beyond the collation of texts, was ready to believe that
similarity of idea in Shakespeare and the classics was due
to direct borrowing. He had, however, the friendly
advice of Warburton to make him beware of the secret
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiv">[pg xxiv]</span><a name="Pgxxiv" id="Pgxxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
satisfaction of pointing out a classical original. In its
earlier form his very unequal Preface had contained the
acute observation that the texture of Shakespeare's phrases
indicated better than his vocabulary the extent of his
knowledge of Latin. The style was submitted as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
truest criterion to determine this long agitated question,”</span>
and the conclusion was implied that Shakespeare could not
have been familiar with the classics. But this interesting
passage was omitted in the second edition, perhaps
because it was inconsistent with a less decided utterance
elsewhere in the Preface, but more probably because it
had been supplied by Warburton. In his earlier days,
before he had met Warburton, he had been emphatic.
In the Preface to his version of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard II.</span></span> he had tried
to do Shakespeare <span class="tei tei-q">“some justice upon the points of his
learning and acquaintance with the Ancients.”</span> He had
said that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Timon of Athens</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Troilus and Cressida</span></span> left it
without dispute or exception that Shakespeare was no inconsiderable
master of the Greek story; he dared be
positive that the latter play was founded directly upon
Homer; he held that Shakespeare must have known
Aeschylus, Lucian, and Plutarch in the Greek; and he
claimed that he could, <span class="tei tei-q">“with the greatest ease imaginable,”</span>
produce above five hundred passages from the three
Roman plays to prove Shakespeare's intimacy with the
Latin classics. When he came under the influence of
Warburton he lost his assurance. He was then <span class="tei tei-q">“very
cautious of declaring too positively”</span> on either side of the
question; but he was loath to give up his belief that
Shakespeare knew the classics at first hand. Warburton
himself did not figure creditably in the controversy. He
might ridicule the discoveries of other critics, but his vanity
often allured him to displays of learning as absurd as
theirs. No indecision troubled Upton or Zachary Grey.
They saw in Shakespeare a man of profound reading, one
who might well have worn out his eyes in poring over
classic tomes. They clutched at anything to show his
deliberate imitation of the Ancients. There could be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxv">[pg xxv]</span><a name="Pgxxv" id="Pgxxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no better instance of the ingenious folly of this type of
criticism than the passage in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes on Shakespeare</span></span>,
where Grey argues from Gloucester's words in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard III.</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Go you before and I will follow you,”</span> that Shakespeare
knew, and was indebted to, Terence's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>. About the
same time Peter Whalley, the editor of Ben Jonson,
brought out his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enquiry into the Learning of Shakespeare</span></span>
(1748), the first formal treatise devoted directly to the
subject of controversy. Therein it is claimed that Shakespeare
knew Latin well enough to have acquired in it a
taste and elegance of judgment, and was more indebted to
the Ancients than was commonly imagined. On the
whole, however, Whalley's attitude was more reasonable
than that of Upton or Grey, for he admitted that his list
of parallel passages might not settle the point at issue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After such a display of misapplied learning it is
refreshing to meet with the common sense of one who
was a greater scholar than any of these pedants. Johnson
has less difficulty in giving his opinion on the extent
of Shakespeare's learning than in discovering the reasons
of the controversy. The evidence of Shakespeare's contemporary,
he says, ought to decide the question unless
some testimony of equal force can be opposed, and such
testimony he refuses to find in the collections of the
Uptons and Greys. It is especially remarkable that
Johnson, who is not considered to have been strong in
research, should be the first to state that Shakespeare used
North's translation of Plutarch. He is the first also to
point out that there was an English translation of the play
on which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedy of Errors</span></span> was founded,<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> and the first
to show that it was not necessary to go back to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tale
of Gamelyn</span></span> for the story of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As you like it</span></span>. There is no
evidence how he came by this knowledge. The casual
and allusive manner in which he advances his information
would seem to show that it was not of his own getting.
He may have been indebted for it to the scholar who two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span><a name="Pgxxvi" id="Pgxxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
years later put an end to the controversy. The edition of
Shakespeare did not appear till October, 1765, and early
in that year Johnson had spent his <span class="tei tei-q">“joyous evening”</span> at
Cambridge with Richard Farmer.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare</span></span> is not an
independent treatise like Whalley's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enquiry</span></span>, but rather a
detailed reply to the arguments of Upton and his fellows.
Farmer had once been idle enough, he tells us himself, to
collect parallel passages, but he had been saved by his
remarkable bibliographical knowledge. He found out
that the literature of the age of Elizabeth was a better
hunting ground than the classics for Shakespearian commentators.
Again and again he shows that passages
which had been urged as convincing proof of knowledge
of Latin or Greek are either borrowed from contemporary
translations or illustrated by contemporary usage. In so
far as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> aims at showing the futility of the arguments
advanced to prove Shakespeare's learning, it is
convincing. The only criticism that can reasonably be
passed on it is that Farmer is apt to think he has proved
his own case when he has merely destroyed the evidence
of his opponents. His conclusion regarding Shakespeare's
knowledge of French and Italian may be too extreme to
be generally accepted now, and indeed it may not be
logically deducible from his examination of the arguments
of other critics; but on the whole the book is a remarkably
able study. Though Farmer speaks expressly of
acquitting <span class="tei tei-q">“our great poet of all piratical depredations
on the Ancients,”</span> his purpose has often been misunderstood,
or at least misrepresented. He aimed at giving
Shakespeare the greater commendation, but certain critics
of the earlier half of the nineteenth century would have
it that he had tried to prove, for his own glory, that
Shakespeare was a very ignorant fellow. William Maginn
in particular proclaimed the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“piece of pedantic
impertinence not paralleled in literature.”</span> The early
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvii">[pg xxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxvii" id="Pgxxvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Variorum editions had acknowledged its value by reprinting
it in its entirety, besides quoting from it liberally in the
notes to the separate plays, and Maginn determined to do
his best to rid them in future of this <span class="tei tei-q">“superfluous
swelling.”</span> So he indulged in a critical Donnybrook; but
after hitting out and about at the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> for three months
he left it much as he found it.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> He could not get to
close quarters with Farmer's scholarship. His bluster
compares ill with Farmer's gentler manner, and in some
passages the quiet humour has proved too subtle for his
animosity. There was more impartiality in the judgment
of Johnson: <span class="tei tei-q">“Dr. Farmer, you have done that which was
never done before; that is, you have completely finished a
controversy beyond all further doubt.”</span><a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the publication of Farmer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> there was a
change in the character of the editions of Shakespeare.
Farmer is the forerunner of Steevens and Malone. He
had a just idea of the importance of his work when he
spoke of himself as the pioneer of the commentators. It
did not matter whether his main contention were accepted;
he had at least shown the wealth of illustration which was
awaiting the scholar who cared to search in the literature
of Shakespeare's age, and Steevens and Malone were not
slow to follow. They had the advantage of being early
in the field; but it is doubtful if any later editor has
contributed as much as either of them did to the elucidation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxviii">[pg xxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxviii" id="Pgxxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Shakespeare's text. They have been oftener
borrowed from than has been admitted, and many a
learned note of later date may be found in germ in their
editions. But with the advance of detailed scholarship the
Prefaces deteriorate in literary merit. They concern
themselves more and more with textual and bibliographical
points, and hence, if they are of greater interest to the
student, they are of less value as indications of the
century's regard for Shakespeare. The change is already
noticeable in Capell's Preface, on the literary shortcomings
of which Johnson expressed himself so forcibly. Johnson
is the last editor whose Preface is a piece of general
criticism. It is an essay which can stand by itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the time of Johnson and Capell the editor of
Shakespeare has come to a clear idea of his <span class="tei tei-q">“true duty.”</span>
Rowe had no suspicion of the textual problems awaiting
his successors. A dramatist himself, he wished merely to
publish Shakespeare's plays as he would publish his own.
Accordingly he modernised the spelling, divided the
scenes, and added lists of dramatis personae; and the
folio gave place to six octavo volumes. He was content
to found his text on the fourth Folio, the last and
worst; he had no idea of the superior claims of the
first, though he professed to have compared the several
editions. He corrected many errors and occasionally hit
upon a happy emendation; but on the whole his interest
in Shakespeare was that of the dramatist. Pope's interest
was that of the poet. There is some truth in the criticism
that he gave Shakespeare not as he was, but as he ought
to be, though Pope might well have retorted that in his
opinion the two conditions were identical. Whatever did
not conform to his opinion of Shakespeare's style he
treated as an interpolation. His collation of the texts, by
convincing him of their corruption, only prompted him to
a more liberal exercise of his own judgment. In the
supplementary volume of Pope's edition, it had been
suggested by Sewell that our great writers should be
treated in the same way as the classics were, and the idea
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxix">[pg xxix]</span><a name="Pgxxix" id="Pgxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was put into practice by Theobald, who could say that his
method of editing was <span class="tei tei-q">“the first assay of the kind on any
modern author whatsoever.”</span> By his careful collation of
the Quartos and Folios, he pointed the way to the
modern editor. But he was followed by Hanmer, who,
as his chief interest was to rival Pope, was content with
Pope's methods. It is easy to underestimate the value of
Hanmer's edition; his happy conjectures have been prejudiced
by his neglect of the older copies and his unfortunate
attempt to regularise the metre; but what alone concerns
us here is that he reverts to the methods which Theobald
had discarded. Warburton, confident in his intellectual
gifts, was satisfied with Theobald's examination of the early
copies, and trusted to his own insight <span class="tei tei-q">“to settle the genuine
text.”</span> The critical ingenuity of editors and commentators,
before the authority of the Folios was established, betrayed
them into inevitable error. The amusing variety
of conjectural readings was met by the exquisite satire of
Fielding,<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> as well as by the heavy censure of Grub Street.
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is to be wished,”</span> says a catchpenny publication, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
the original text of Shakespeare were left unaltered for
every English reader to understand. The numerous fry
of commentators will at last explain his original meaning
away.”</span><a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> This criticism was out of date by the time of
Johnson and Capell. As it has long been the fashion to
decry Johnson's edition, it is well to recall two statements
in his Preface, which show that he had already discovered
what later editors have found out for themselves:

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxx">[pg xxx]</span><a name="Pgxxx" id="Pgxxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Johnson's collation may not have been thorough; but no
modern editor can say that he proceeded on a wrong
method.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Johnson has included in his Preface an account of the
work of earlier editors, and it is the first attempt of the
kind which is impartial. He shows that Rowe has been
blamed for not performing what he did not undertake; he
is severe on Pope for the allusion to the <span class="tei tei-q">“dull duty of an
editor,”</span> as well as for the performance of it, though he
also finds much to praise; he does more justice to Sir
Thomas Hammer than has commonly been done since;
and he is not silent on the weaknesses of Warburton.
The only thing in this unprejudiced account which is
liable to criticism is his treatment of Theobald. But the
censure is as just as the praise which it is now the
fashion to heap on him. Though Theobald was the first
to pay due respect to the original editions, we cannot,
in estimating his capacity, ignore the evidence of his
correspondence with Warburton. In the more detailed
account of his work given below, it is shown that there
was a large measure of justice in the common verdict
of the eighteenth century, but it was only prejudiced
critics like Pope or Warburton who would say that
his Shakespearian labours were futile. Johnson is
careful to state that <span class="tei tei-q">“what little he did was commonly
right.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would appear that Macaulay's estimate of Johnson's
own edition has been generally accepted, even by those
who in other matters remark on the historian's habit of
exaggeration. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Preface,”</span> we read, <span class="tei tei-q">“though it contains
some good passages, is not in his best manner. The
most valuable notes are those in which he had an opportunity
of showing how attentively he had, during many
years, observed human life and human nature. The best
specimen is the note on the character of Polonius. Nothing
so good is to be found even in Wilhelm Meister's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxi">[pg xxxi]</span><a name="Pgxxxi" id="Pgxxxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
admirable examination of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>. But here praise must
end. It would be difficult to name a more slovenly, a
more worthless edition of any great classic. The reader
may turn over play after play without finding one happy
conjectural emendation, or one ingenious and satisfactory explanation of
a passage which had baffled preceding commentators.”</span><a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>
And we still find it repeated that his
edition was a failure. Johnson distrusted conjecture; but
that there is not one happy conjectural emendation is only
less glaringly untrue than the other assertion that there is
not one new ingenious and satisfactory explanation. Even
though we make allowance for Macaulay's mannerism, it
is difficult to believe that he had honestly consulted the
edition. Those who have worked with it know the force
of Johnson's claim that not a single passage in the whole
work had appeared to him corrupt which he had not
attempted to restore, or obscure which he had not endeavoured
to illustrate. We may neglect the earlier
eighteenth-century editions of Shakespeare, but if we
neglect Johnson's we run a serious risk. We may now
abandon his text; we must rely on later scholarship for
the explanation of many allusions; but, wherever a
difficulty can be solved by common sense, we shall never
find his notes antiquated. Other editions are distinguished
by accuracy, ingenuity, or learning; the supreme
distinction of his is sagacity. He cleared a way through
a mass of misleading conjectures. In disputed passages
he has an almost unerring instinct for the explanation
which alone can be right; and when the reading is corrupt
beyond emendation, he gives the most helpful statement of
the probable meaning. Not only was Johnson's edition
the best which had yet appeared; it is still one of the
few editions which are indispensable.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third quarter of the eighteenth century, and not
the first quarter of the nineteenth, is the true period of
transition in Shakespearian criticism. The dramatic rules
had been finally deposed. The corrected plays were
falling into disfavour, and though Shakespeare's dramas
were not yet acted as they were written, more respect was
being paid to the originals. The sixty years' controversy
on the extent of his learning had ended by proving that the
best commentary on him is the literature of his own age.
At the same time there is a far-reaching change in the
literary appreciations of Shakespeare, which announces the
school of Coleridge and Hazlitt: his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">characters</span></em> now
become the main topics of criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the five essays on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempest</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King Lear</span></span>
contributed by Joseph Warton to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adventurer</span></span> in
1753-54, we can recognise the coming change in critical
methods. He began them by giving in a sentence a
summary of the common verdicts: <span class="tei tei-q">“As Shakespeare is
sometimes blamable for the conduct of his fables, which
have no unity; and sometimes for his diction, which is
obscure and turgid; so his characteristical excellences may
possibly be reduced to these three general heads—his
lively creative imagination, his strokes of nature and
passion, and his preservation of the consistency of his
characters.”</span> Warton himself believed in the dramatic
conventions. He objected to the Edmund story in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King
Lear</span></span> on the ground that it destroyed the unity of the
fable. But he had the wisdom to recognise that irregularities
in structure may be excused by the representation
of the persons of the drama.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>
Accordingly, in his examination
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempest</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King Lear</span></span>, he pays most
attention to the characters, and relegates to a short
closing paragraph his criticism of the development of the
action. Though his method has nominally much in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxiii">[pg xxxiii]</span><a name="Pgxxxiii" id="Pgxxxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
common with that of Maurice Morgann and the romantic
critics, in practice it is very different. He treats the
characters from without: he lacks the intuitive sympathy
which is the secret of later criticism. To him the
play is a representation of life, not a transcript from
life. The characters, who are more real to us than actual
persons of history, and more intimate than many an
acquaintance, appear to him to be creatures of the
imagination who live in a different world from his
own. Warton describes the picture: he criticises the
portraits of the characters rather than the characters
themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The gradual change in the critical attitude is illustrated
also by Lord Kames, whom Heath had reason to describe,
before the appearance of Johnson's Preface, as <span class="tei tei-q">“the truest
judge and most intelligent admirer of Shakespeare.”</span><a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>
The scheme of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elements of Criticism</span></span> (1762) allowed
him to deal with Shakespeare only incidentally, as in the
digression where he distinguishes between the presentation
and the description of passion, but he gives more decisive
expression to Warton's view that observance of the rules
is of subordinate importance to the truthful exhibition of
character. The mechanical part, he observes, in which
alone Shakespeare is defective, is less the work of genius
than of experience, and it is knowledge of human nature
which gives him his supremacy. The same views are
repeated in the periodical essays. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mirror</span></span> regards it
as <span class="tei tei-q">“preposterous”</span> to endeavour to regularise his plays,
and finds the source of his superiority in his almost supernatural
powers of invention, his absolute command over
the passions, and his wonderful knowledge of nature; and
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lounger</span></span> says that he presents the abstract of life in all
its modes and in every time. The rules are forgotten,—we
cease to hear even that they are useless. But the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elements of Criticism</span></span> gave Kames no opportunity to show
that his attitude to the characters themselves was other
than Warton's.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxiv">[pg xxxiv]</span><a name="Pgxxxiv" id="Pgxxxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No critic had questioned Shakespeare's truth to nature.
The flower of Pope's Preface is the section on his
knowledge of the world and his power over the passions.
Lyttleton showed his intimacy with Pope's opinion when
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogues of the Dead</span></span> he made him say: <span class="tei tei-q">“No
author had ever so copious, so bold, so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">creative</span></em> an
imagination, with so perfect a knowledge of the passions,
the humours and sentiments of mankind. He painted all
characters, from kings down to peasants, with equal truth
and equal force. If human nature were destroyed, and
no monument were left of it except his works, other
beings might know what man was from those writings.”</span>
The same eulogy is repeated in other words by Johnson.
And in Gray's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Progress of Poesy</span></span> Shakespeare is <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature's
Darling.”</span> It was his diction which gave most scope
to the censure of the better critics. An age whose
literary watchwords were simplicity and precision was
bound to remark on his obscurities and plays on words,
and even, as Dryden had done, on his bombast. What
Shaftesbury<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> or Atterbury<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>
had said at the beginning of
the century is repeated, as we should expect, by the
rhetoricians, such as Blair. But it was shown by Kames
that the merit of Shakespeare's language lay in the
absence of those abstract and general terms which were
the blemish of the century's own diction. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shakespeare's
style in that respect,”</span> says Kames, <span class="tei tei-q">“is excellent: every
article in his descriptions is particular, as in nature.”</span> And
herein Kames gave independent expression to the views of
the poet who is said to have lived in the wrong century.
<span class="tei tei-q">“In truth,”</span> said Gray, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shakespeare's language is one of
his principal beauties; and he has no less advantage over
your Addisons and Rowes in this than in those other
great excellences you mention. Every word in him is a
picture.”</span><a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first book devoted directly to the examination of
Shakespeare's characters was by William Richardson,
Professor of Humanity in the University of Glasgow.
His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophical Analysis and Illustration of some of
Shakespeare's remarkable Characters</span></span>, which dealt with
Macbeth, Hamlet, Jaques, and Imogen, appeared in
1774; ten years later he added a second series on
Richard III., King Lear, and Timon of Athens; and in
1789 he concluded his character studies with his essay on
Falstaff. As the titles show, Richardson's work has a
moral purpose. His intention, as he tells us, was to
make poetry subservient to philosophy, and to employ it
in tracing the principles of human conduct. Accordingly,
he has prejudiced his claims as a literary critic. He is not
interested in Shakespeare's art for its own sake; but that
he should use Shakespeare's characters as the subjects of
moral disquisitions is eloquent testimony to their truth to
nature. His classical bias, excusable in a Professor of
Latin, is best seen in his essay <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Faults of
Shakespeare,”</span><a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>
of which the title was alone sufficient to
win him the contempt of later critics. His essays are the
dull effusions of a clever man. Though they are not
inspiriting, they are not without interest. He recognised
that the source of Shakespeare's greatness is that he
became for the time the person whom he represented.

Before the appearance of Richardson's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophical
Analysis</span></span>, Thomas Whately had written his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Remarks
on Some of the Characters of Shakespeare</span></span>; but it was
not published till 1785. The author, who died in
1772, had abandoned it in order to complete, in
1770, his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observations on Modern Gardening</span></span>. The
book contains only a short introduction and a comparison
of Macbeth and Richard III. The fragment
is sufficient, however, to indicate more clearly than the
work of Richardson the coming change. The author
has himself remarked on the novelty of his method.
The passage must be quoted, as it is the first definite
statement that the examination of Shakespeare's characters
should be the main object of Shakespearian
criticism:
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The writers upon dramatic composition have, for
the most part, confined their observations to the
fable; and the maxims received amongst them, for
the conduct of it, are therefore emphatically called,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">The Rules of the Drama</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. It has been found easy to
give and to apply them; they are obvious, they are
certain, they are general: and poets without genius
have, by observing them, pretended to fame; while
critics without discernment have assumed importance
from knowing them. But the regularity thereby
established, though highly proper, is by no means
the first requisite in a dramatic composition. Even
waiving all consideration of those finer feelings
which a poet's imagination or sensibility imparts,
there is, within the colder provinces of judgment
and of knowledge, a subject for criticism
more worthy of attention than the common topics
of discussion: I mean the distinction and preservation
of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">character</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earlier critics who remarked on Shakespeare's depiction
of character had not suspected that the examination
of it was to oust the older methods.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxvii">[pg xxxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxxvii" id="Pgxxxvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A greater writer, who has met with unaccountable
neglect, was to express the same views independently.
Maurice Morgann had apparently written his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on the
Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff</span></span> about 1774, in an
interval of political employment, but he was not prevailed
upon to publish it till 1777. The better we know it, the
more we shall regret that it is the only critical work which
he allowed to survive. He too refers to his book as a
<span class="tei tei-q">“novelty.”</span> He believes the task of considering Shakespeare
in detail to have been <span class="tei tei-q">“hitherto unattempted.”</span>
But his main object, unlike Whately's or Richardson's, is
a <span class="tei tei-q">“critique on the genius, the arts, and the conduct
of Shakespeare.”</span> He concentrates his attention on
a single character, only to advance to more general
criticism. <span class="tei tei-q">“Falstaff is the word only, Shakespeare is
the theme.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Morgann's book did not meet with the attention
which it deserved, nor to this day has its importance
been fully recognised. Despite his warnings, his contemporaries
regarded it simply as a defence of Falstaff's
courage. One spoke of him as a paradoxical critic,
and others doubted if he meant what he said. All
were unaccountably indifferent to his main purpose.
The book was unknown even to Hazlitt, who in the
preface to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Characters of Shakespeare's Plays</span></span> alludes
only to Whately<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> and Richardson as his English predecessors.
Yet it is the true forerunner of the romantic
criticism of Shakespeare. Morgann's attitude to the
characters is the same as Coleridge's and Hazlitt's; his
criticism, neglecting all formal matters, resolves itself into
a study of human nature. It was he who first said that
Shakespeare's creations should be treated as historic rather
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxviii">[pg xxxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxxviii" id="Pgxxxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than as dramatic beings. And the keynote of his criticism
is that <span class="tei tei-q">“the impression is the fact.”</span> He states what he
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feels</span></em>, and he explains the reason in language which is
barely on this side idolatry.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a>

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rowe has the double honour of being the first editor
of the plays of Shakespeare and the first to attempt
an authoritative account of his life. The value of the
biography can best be judged by comparing it with the
accounts given in such books as Fuller's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Worthies of
England</span></span> (1662), Phillips's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theatrum Poetarum</span></span> (1675),
Winstanley's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English Poets</span></span> (1687), Langbaine's

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Historical and Poetical Dictionary</span></span>
(1701). Though some of the traditions—for which he has
acknowledged his debt to Betterton—are of doubtful
accuracy, it is safe to say that but for Rowe they would
have perished.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account of Shakespeare</span></span> was the standard biography
during the eighteenth century. It was reprinted by Pope,
Hanmer, Warburton, Johnson, Steevens, Malone, and
Reed; but they did not give it in the form in which Rowe
had left it. Pope took the liberty of condensing and
rearranging it, and as he did not acknowledge what he
had done, his silence led other editors astray. Those
who did note the alterations presumed that they had been
made by Rowe himself in the second edition in 1714.
Steevens, for instance, states that he publishes the life
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxix">[pg xxxix]</span><a name="Pgxxxix" id="Pgxxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from <span class="tei tei-q">“Rowe's second edition, in which it had been
abridged and altered by himself after its appearance in
1709.”</span> But what Steevens reprints is Rowe's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account of
Shakespeare</span></span> as edited by Pope. In this volume the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account</span></span>
is given in its original form for the first time since 1714.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope omitted passages dealing only indirectly with
Shakespeare, or expressing opinions with which he disagreed.
He also placed the details of Shakespeare's later
years (pp. <a href="#Pg021" class="tei tei-ref">21-3</a>) immediately after the account of his
relationship with Ben Jonson (p. <a href="#Pg009" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>), so that the biography
might form a complete portion by itself. With the exception
of an occasional word, nothing occurs in the emended
edition which is not to be found somewhere in the first.

A seventh and supplementary volume containing the
Poems was added in 1710. It included Charles Gildon's

John Dennis's three letters <span class="tei tei-q">“on the genius and writings

together in 1712 under the title <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">An Essay on the Genius

also two letters on the 40th and 47th numbers of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span>. All were reprinted in Dennis's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Original Letters, Familiar, Moral and Critical</span></span>, 2 vols., 1721.
The Dedication is to George Granville, then Secretary
at War. <span class="tei tei-q">“To whom,”</span> says Dennis, <span class="tei tei-q">“can an
Essay upon the Genius and Writings of Shakespear be
so properly address'd, as to him who best understands

about Shakespeare in its five dialogues, their main purpose
being to show the absurdity of Rymer's plea for adopting
the Greek methods in the English drama. Dennis had,
however, great respect for Rymer's ability. In the first
letter to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span> he says that Rymer <span class="tei tei-q">“will always

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope's edition of Shakespeare was published by Tonson
in six quarto volumes. The first appeared in 1725, as
the title-page shows; all the others are dated <span class="tei tei-q">“1723.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the note to the line in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dunciad</span></span> in which he
laments his <span class="tei tei-q">“ten years to comment and translate,”</span> Pope
gives us to understand that he prepared his edition of
Shakespeare after he had completed the translation of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iliad</span></span> and before he set to work on the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Odyssey</span></span>. His
own correspondence, however, shows that he was engaged
on Shakespeare and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Odyssey</span></span> at the same time. There
is some uncertainty as to when his edition was begun.
The inference to be drawn from a letter to Pope from
Atterbury is that it had been undertaken by August,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexli">[pg xli]</span><a name="Pgxli" id="Pgxli" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
1721. We have more definite information as to the date
of its completion. In a letter to Broome of 31st October,
1724, Pope writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“Shakespear is finished. I have
just written the Preface, and in less than three weeks it
will be public”</span> (Ed. Elwin and Courthope, viii. 88).
But it did not appear till March. Pope himself was
partly to blame for the delay. In December we find
Tonson <span class="tei tei-q">“impatient”</span> for the return of the Preface (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span> ix.
547). In the revision of the text Pope was assisted by
Fenton and Gay (see Reed's Variorum edition, 1803,
ii. p. 149).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A seventh volume containing the poems was added in
1725, but Pope had no share in it. It is a reprint of the
supplementary volume of Rowe's edition, <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole
revised and corrected, with a Preface, by Dr. Sewell.”</span>
The most prominent share in this volume of <span class="tei tei-q">“Pope's
Shakespeare”</span> thus fell to Charles Gildon, who had
attacked Pope in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art of Poetry</span></span> and elsewhere, and
was to appear later in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dunciad</span></span>. Sewell's preface
is dated Nov. 24, 1724.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope made few changes in his Preface in the second
edition (1728, 8 vols., 12mo). The chief difference is
the inclusion of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Double Falshood</span></span>, which Theobald
had produced in 1727 as Shakespeare's, in the list of
the spurious plays.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The references in the Preface to the old actors were
criticised by John Roberts in 1729 in a pamphlet entitled
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">An Answer to Mr. Pope's Preface to Shakespear. In a
Letter to a Friend. Being a Vindication of the Old Actors

Theobald had long been interested in Shakespeare.
In 1715 he had written the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cave of Poverty</span></span>, a poem <span class="tei tei-q">“in
imitation of Shakespeare,”</span> and in 1720 he had brought
out an adaptation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard II</span></span>. But it was not till
1726—though the Dedication bears the date of March
18, 1725—that he produced his first direct contribution
to Shakespearian scholarship,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare restored:
or, a Specimen of the Many Errors, as well Committed, as
Unamended, by Mr. Pope in his Late Edition of this Poet.

the True Reading of Shakespeare in all the Editions ever
yet publish'd.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We learn from a letter by Theobald dated 15th April,
1729, that he had been in correspondence with Pope
fully two years before the publication of this volume.
(See Nichols, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Illustrations of the Literary History of the
Eighteenth Century</span></span>, ii., p. 221). Pope, however, had not
encouraged his advances. In the same letter Theobald
states that he had no design of commenting on Shakespeare
till he saw <span class="tei tei-q">“how incorrect an edition Mr. Pope had
given the publick.”</span> This remark was prompted by a
note in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dunciad</span></span> of 1729, where it was stated that
<span class="tei tei-q">“during the space of two years, while Mr. Pope was
preparing his Edition of Shakespear, and published
advertisements, requesting all lovers of the author to
contribute to a more perfect one, this Restorer (who
had then some correspondence with him, and was solliciting
favours by letters) did wholly conceal his design, 'till
after its publication.”</span> But if Theobald had not thought
of issuing comments on Shakespeare's plays till Pope's
edition appeared, he must have known them well already,
for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare Restored</span></span> is not a hasty piece of work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Despite the aggressiveness of the title, Theobald protests
his regard for Pope in such passages as these:

Whether or not these declarations were sincere, they
would hardly have stayed the resentment of a less
sensitive man than Pope when passage after passage
was pointed out where errors were <span class="tei tei-q">“as well committed
as unamended.”</span> Theobald even hazarded the roguish
suggestion that the bookseller had played his editor false
by not sending him all the sheets to revise; and he
certainly showed that the readings of Rowe's edition had
occasionally been adopted without the professed collation
of the older copies. The volume could raise no
doubt of Theobald's own diligence. The chief part of
it is devoted to an examination of the text of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>,
but there is a long appendix dealing with readings in other

nose was as sharp as a pen, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a' babled of green
fields</span></em>.”</span> It should be noted that the credit of this
reading is not entirely Theobald's. He admits that in
an edition <span class="tei tei-q">“with some marginal conjectures of a
Gentleman sometime deceased”</span> he found the emendation
<span class="tei tei-q">“and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a' talked</span></em> of green fields.”</span> Theobald's share thus
amounts to the doubtful improvement of substituting
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">babbled</span></em> for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">talked</span></em>.

Though this volume has undoubted merits, it is not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexliv">[pg xliv]</span><a name="Pgxliv" id="Pgxliv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
difficult to understand why the name of Theobald came
to convey to the eighteenth century the idea of painful
pedantry, and why one so eminently just as Johnson
should have dubbed him <span class="tei tei-q">“a man of heavy diligence,
with very slender powers.”</span> While his knowledge is
indisputable, he has little or no delicacy of taste; his
style is dull and lumbering; and the mere fact that he
dedicated his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare Restored</span></span> to John Rich, the
Covent Garden manager who specialised in pantomime
and played the part of harlequin, may at least cast some
doubt on his discretion. But he successfully attacked
Pope where he was weakest and where as an editor he
should have been strongest. <span class="tei tei-q">“From this time,”</span> in the
words of Johnson, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pope became an enemy to editors,
collators, commentators, and verbal critics; and hoped
to persuade the world that he had miscarried in this
undertaking only by having a mind too great for such
minute employment.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not content with the errors pointed out in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare
Restored</span></span>—a quarto volume of two hundred pages—Theobald
continued his criticisms of Pope's edition in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mist's Journal</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Daily Journal</span></span>, until he was ripe for
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dunciad</span></span>. Pope enthroned him as the hero of the
poem, and so he remained till he was replaced by Colley
Cibber in 1741, when the alteration necessitated several
omissions. In the earlier editions Theobald soliloquised
thus:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theobald is introduced also in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art of Sinking in Poetry</span></span>
among the classes of authors described as swallows and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlv">[pg xlv]</span><a name="Pgxlv" id="Pgxlv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eels: the former <span class="tei tei-q">“are eternally skimming and fluttering
up and down, but all their agility is employed to catch
flies,”</span> the latter <span class="tei tei-q">“wrap themselves up in their own mud,
but are mighty nimble and pert.”</span> About the same time,
however, Pope brought out the second edition (1728) of
his Shakespeare, and in it he incorporated some of
Theobald's conjectures, though his recognition of their
merit was grudging and even dishonestly inadequate.
(See the preface to the various readings at the end of the
eighth volume, 1728.) Yet one's sympathies with
Theobald are prejudiced by his ascription to Shakespeare
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Double Falshood, or the Distrest Lovers</span></span>, a play
which was acted in 1727 and printed in the following
year. Theobald professed to have revised it and adapted
it to the stage. The question of authorship has not been
settled, but if Theobald is relieved from the imputation of
forgery, he must at least stand convicted of ignorance of
the Shakespearian manner. Pope at once recognised
that the play was not Shakespeare's, and added a contemptuous
reference to it in the second edition of his
Preface. It was the opinion of Farmer that the groundwork
of the play was by Shirley (see the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on the
Learning of Shakespeare</span></span>, p. 181).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theobald now sought to revenge himself on Pope, and,
in his own words, he <span class="tei tei-q">“purposed to reply only in Shakespeare”</span>
(Nichols, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span> ii., p. 248). His first plan was to
publish a volume of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Remarks on Shakespeare</span></span>. On 15th
April, 1729, he says the volume <span class="tei tei-q">“will now shortly appear
in the world”</span> (id., p. 222), but on 6th November he
writes to Warburton, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know you will not be displeased,
if I should tell you in your ear, perhaps I may venture
to join the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Text</span></span>
to my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Remarks</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span>, p. 254). By the
following March he had definitely determined upon
giving an edition of Shakespeare, as appears from another
letter to Warburton: <span class="tei tei-q">“As it is necessary I should now
inform the publick that I mean to attempt to give them
an edition of that Poet's [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Shakespeare's] text, together
with my corrections, I have concluded to give this notice,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlvi">[pg xlvi]</span><a name="Pgxlvi" id="Pgxlvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not only by advertisements, but by an occasional
pamphlet, which, in order to retaliate some of our
Editor's kindnesses to me, I mean to call, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">An Essay upon
Mr. Pope's Judgment, extracted from his own Works; and
humbly addressed to him</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span> ii., p. 551). Of this he
forwards Warburton an extract. The pamphlet does not
appear to have been published. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miscellany on
Taste</span></span> which he brought out anonymously in 1732
contains a section entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Of Mr. Pope's Taste of
Shakespeare,”</span> but this is merely a reprint of the letter
of 15th (or 16th) April, which had already been
printed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Daily Journal</span></span>. A considerable time
elapsed before arrangements for publication were completed,
the interval being marked by a temporary
estrangement from Warburton and an unsuccessful
candidature for the laureateship. Articles with Tonson
were signed in November, 1731 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span> ii., pp. 13, 618),
and at the same time the correspondence with Warburton
was renewed. The edition did not appear till 1733.
The Preface had been begun about the end of 1731.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From March, 1729, with the short break in 1730,
Theobald had been in steady correspondence with Warburton,
and most of his letters, with a few of those of
Warburton, have been preserved by Nichols (see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span> ii.,
pp. 189, 607). But it would have been more fortunate
for Theobald's reputation had they perished. The cruel
contempt and bitterness of Warburton's references to him
after their final estrangement may be offensive, but the
correspondence shows that they were not without some
justification. Theobald submits his conjectures anxiously
to the judgment of Warburton, and again and again
Warburton saves him from himself. In one of the
letters Theobald rightly condemns Pope's proposed
insertion of <span class="tei tei-q">“Francis Drake”</span> in the incomplete line at
the end of the first scene of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry VI., Part 1.</span></span>; but not
content with this flawless piece of destructive criticism he
argues for inserting the words <span class="tei tei-q">“and Cassiopeia.”</span> The
probability is that if Warburton had not condemned the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlvii">[pg xlvii]</span><a name="Pgxlvii" id="Pgxlvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proposal it would have appeared in Theobald's edition.
<span class="tei tei-q">“With a just deference to your most convincing reasons,”</span>
says Theobald, <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall with great cheerfulness banish it
as a bad and unsupported conjecture”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span> ii., p. 477);
and this remark is typical of the whole correspondence.
A considerable share of the merit of Theobald's edition—though
the share is mostly negative—belongs to Warburton,
for Theobald had not taste enough to keep him
right when he stepped beyond collation of the older
editions or explanation by parallel passages. Indeed, the
letters to Warburton, besides helping to explain his
reputation in the eighteenth century, would in themselves
be sufficient to justify his place in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dunciad</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Warburton had undoubtedly given Theobald ungrudging
assistance and was plainly interested in the
success of the edition. But as he had gauged Theobald's
ability, he had some fears for the Preface. So at least we
gather from a letter which Theobald wrote to him on
18th November, 1731:
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

come last in play, I shall certainly be so kind to myself to communicate
in due time to your perusal. The whole affair of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Prolegomena</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> I have
determined to soften into </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Preface</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. I am so very cool as to my
sentiments of my Adversary's usage, that I think the publick should not
be too largely troubled with them. </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Blockheadry</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is the chief hinge
of his satire upon me; and if my Edition do not wipe out that, I ought to
be content to let the charge be fixed; if it do, the reputation gained
will be a greater triumph than resentment. But, dear Sir, will you, at
your leisure hours, think over for me upon the contents, topics, orders,
etc., of this branch of my labour? You have a comprehensive memory,
and a happiness of digesting the matter joined to it, which my head is
often too much embarrassed to perform; let that be the excuse for my
inability. But how unreasonable is it to expect this labour, when it is
the only part in which I shall not be able to be just to my friends: for,
to confess assistance in a </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Preface</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> will, I am afraid, make me
appear too naked. Rymer's extravagant rancour against our Author, under the
umbrage of criticism, may, I presume, find a place here</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">id.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">

</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This confession of weakness is valuable in the light of
Warburton's Preface to his own edition of 1747. His
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlviii">[pg xlviii]</span><a name="Pgxlviii" id="Pgxlviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
statement of the assistance he rendered Theobald is
rude and cruel, but it is easier to impugn his taste than
his truthfulness. Theobald did not merely ask for
assistance in the Preface; he received it too. Warburton
expressed himself on this matter, with his customary force
and with a pleasing attention to detail, in a letter to the
Rev. Thomas Birch on 24th November, 1737. <span class="tei tei-q">“You will
see in Theobald's heap of disjointed stuff,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“which
he calls a Preface to Shakespeare, an observation upon
those poems [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">L'Allegro</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Il Penseroso</span></span>] which I made
to him, and which he did not understand, and so has
made it a good deal obscure by contracting my note; for
you must understand that almost all that Preface (except
what relates to Shakespeare's Life, and the foolish Greek
conjectures at the end) was made up of notes I sent him
on particular passages, and which he has there stitched
together without head or tail”</span> (Nichols, ii., p. 81).
The Preface is indeed a poor piece of patch-work.
Examination of the footnotes throughout the edition
corroborates Warburton's concluding statement. Some
of the annotations which have his name attached to them
are repeated almost verbatim (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
the note in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Love's
Labour's Lost</span></span> on the use of music), while the comparison
of Addison and Shakespeare is taken from a
letter written by Warburton to Concanen in 1726-7
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span> ii., pp. 195, etc.). The inequality of the essay—the
fitful succession of limp and acute observations—can
be explained only by ill-matched collaboration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Warburton has himself indicated the extent of Theobald's
debt to him. In his own copy of Theobald's
Shakespeare he marked the passages which he had contributed
to the Preface, as well as the notes <span class="tei tei-q">“which
Theobald deprived him of and made his own,”</span> and the
volume is now in the Capell collection in Trinity College,
Cambridge. Mr. Churton Collins, in his attempt to
prove Theobald the greatest of Shakespearean editors, has
said that <span class="tei tei-q">“if in this copy, which we have not had the
opportunity of inspecting, Warburton has laid claim to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlix">[pg xlix]</span><a name="Pgxlix" id="Pgxlix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more than Theobald has assigned to him, we believe him
to be guilty of dishonesty even more detestable than that
of which the proofs are, as we have shown, indisputable.”</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>
An inspection of the Cambridge volume is not necessary
to show that a passage in the Preface has been conveyed
from one of Warburton's letters published by
Nichols and by Malone. Any defence of Theobald
by an absolute refusal to believe Warburton's word can
be of no value unless some proof be adduced that Warburton
was here untruthful, and it is peculiarly inept when
Theobald's own page proclaims the theft. We know
that Theobald asked Warburton for assistance in the
Preface, and gave warning that such assistance would not
be acknowledged. Warburton could have had no evil
motive in marking those passages in his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">private</span></em> copy;
and there is surely a strong presumption in favour of a
man who deliberately goes over seven volumes, carefully
indicating the material which he considered his own. It
happens that one of the passages contains an unfriendly
allusion to Pope. If Warburton meant to be <span class="tei tei-q">“dishonest”</span>—and
there could be no purpose in being dishonest before
he was Theobald's enemy—why did he not disclaim this
allusion some years later? The simple explanation is that
he marked the passages for his own amusement while
he was still on friendly terms with Theobald. They are
thirteen in number, and they vary in length from a few
lines to two pages. Four of them are undoubtedly his,
and there is nothing to disprove that the other nine are
his also.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagel">[pg l]</span><a name="Pgl" id="Pgl" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theobald quotes also from his own correspondence.
On 17th March, 1729-30, he had written to Warburton
a long letter dealing with Shakespeare's knowledge of
languages and including a specimen of his proposed
pamphlet against Pope. <span class="tei tei-q">“Your most necessary caution
against inconsistency, with regard to my opinion of
Shakespeare's knowledge in languages,”</span> he there says
characteristically, <span class="tei tei-q">“shall not fail to have all its weight with
me. And therefore the passages that I occasionally
quote from the Classics shall not be brought as proofs
that he imitated those originals, but to shew how happily
he has expressed themselves upon the same topics”</span>
(Nichols, ii., pp. 564, etc.). This part of the letter is
included verbatim three years afterwards in the Preface.
So also is the other passage in the same letter replying
to Pope on the subject of Shakespeare's anachronisms.
Theobald borrows even from his own published writings.
Certain passages are reproduced from the Introduction
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare Restored</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If Theobald could hardly acknowledge, as he said, the
assistance he received in writing the Preface, he at least
admitted his editorial debt to Warburton and others
punctiliously and handsomely. After referring to Dr.
Thirlby of Jesus College, Cambridge, and Hawley
Bishop, he thus writes of his chief helper:

</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So the preface read in 1733. But by the end of 1734
Warburton had quarrelled with Theobald, and by 1740,
after a passing friendship with Sir Thomas Hanmer, had
become definitely attached to the party of Pope. This
is probably the reason why, in the Preface to the second
edition, Theobald does not repeat the detailed statement
of the assistance he had received. He wisely omits also
the long and irrelevant passage of Greek conjectures,
given with no other apparent reason than to parade his
learning. And several passages either claimed by Warburton
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> that referring to Milton's poems) or known
to be his (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the comparison of Addison and Shakespeare)
are also cancelled.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The merits of the text of Theobald's edition are
undeniable; but the text is not to be taken as the sole
measure of his ability. By his diligence in collation he
restored many of the original readings. His knowledge
of Elizabethan literature was turned to good account in
the explanation and illustration of the text. He claims
to have read above eight hundred old English plays
<span class="tei tei-q">“to ascertain the obsolete and uncommon phrases.”</span> But
when we have spoken of his diligence, we have spoken
of all for which, as an editor, he was remarkable. Pope
had good reason to say of him, though he gave the
criticism a wider application, that

The inner history of his Preface would prove of itself
that Theobald well deserved the notoriety which he
enjoyed in the eighteenth century.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sir Thomas Hanmer's edition of Shakespeare, in six
handsome quarto volumes, was printed at the Clarendon
Press in 1743-44. As it appeared anonymously it was
commonly called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Oxford edition.”</span> It was well
known, however, that Hanmer was the editor. Vols. ii.,
iii., and iv. bear the date 1743; the others, 1744.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hanmer had been Speaker of the House of Commons
from 1713 to 1715, and had played an important part in
securing the Protestant succession on the death of Queen
Anne. He retired from public life on the accession of
George II., and thereafter lived in <span class="tei tei-q">“lettered ease”</span> at his
seat of Mildenhall near Newmarket till his death in 1746.
It is not known when he undertook his edition of Shakespeare,
but the idea of it was probably suggested to him by
the publication of Theobald's edition in 1733. His
relative and biographer, Sir Henry Bunbury, writing in
1838, refers to a copy of this edition with corrections and
notes on the text of every play in Hanmer's handwriting.
There can be no doubt, however, of the accuracy of Warburton's
statement that his edition was printed from
Pope's, though the hastiest examination will prove the
falsity of Warburton's other remark that Hanmer neglected
to compare Pope's edition with Theobald's. He relied
on Pope's judgment as to the authenticity of passages
and on Theobald's accuracy in collation. Thus while
he omits lines which Pope had omitted, or degrades
them to the foot of the page, he often adopts Theobald's
reading of a word or phrase.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He had certainly made considerable progress with the
edition by May, 1738, when he was visited by Warburton
(see Nichols, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Illustrations</span></span>, ii. 44, 69). It was still incomplete
in March, 1742, but it was sent to the printer at the
end of that year, as we learn from a letter of 30th
December to Zachary Grey, the editor of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hudibras</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
must now acquaint you that the books are gone out of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageliii">[pg liii]</span><a name="Pgliii" id="Pgliii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
my hands, and lodged with the University of Oxford,
which hath been willing to accept of them as a present
from me. They intend to print them forthwith, in a fair
impression adorned with sculptures; but it will be so
ordered that it will be the cheapest book that ever was
exposed to sale.... None are to go into the hands of
booksellers”</span> (Nichols, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Literary Anecdotes</span></span>, v., p. 589).
Earlier in the year, in the important letter concerning
his quarrel with Warburton, which will be referred to
later, he had spoken of his edition in the following terms:
<span class="tei tei-q">“As to my own particular, I have no aim to pursue in
this affair; I propose neither honour, reward, or thanks,
and should be very well pleased to have the books continue
upon their shelf, in my own private closet. If it is
thought they may be of use or pleasure to the publick, I
am willing to part with them out of my hands, and to
add, for the honour of Shakespear, some decorations and
embellishments at my own expense”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span> v., p. 589). The
printing of the edition was not supervised by Hanmer
himself, but by Joseph Smith, Provost of Queen's College,
and Robert Shippen, Principal of Brasenose. We find
them receiving instructions that there must be care in the
correction of the press, that the type must be as large as
in Pope's edition, but that the paper must be better.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These facts are of interest in connection with Hanmer's
inclusion in the fourth book of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dunciad</span></span>. In a note
by Pope and Warburton he is referred to as <span class="tei tei-q">“an eminent
person, who was about to publish a very pompous edition
of a great author, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at his own expense</span></em>”</span>; and in the poem
the satire is maladroitly aimed at the handsomeness of
the volumes. Warburton afterwards implied that he
was responsible for the inclusion of this passage (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span>,
p. 590), and though the claim is disputed by Hanmer's
biographer, the ineffectiveness of the attack would prove
that it was not spontaneous. Pope, however, would yield
to Warburton's desire the more readily if, as Sir Henry
Bunbury had reason to believe, the anonymous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Remarks
on the Tragedy of Hamlet</span></span>, published in 1736, was the work
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageliv">[pg liv]</span><a name="Pgliv" id="Pgliv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Hanmer,<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> for there Pope's edition was compared unfavourably,
though courteously, with that of Theobald.

So runs the title of what is generally known as Warburton's
edition. It is professedly a revised issue of
Pope's. In point of fact it is founded, not on Pope's
text, but on the text of Theobald. Warburton does not
follow even Pope's arrangement of the plays. With one
insignificant transposition, he gives them in the identical
order in which they appear in Theobald's edition. And
though he has his gibe at Hanmer in the title page, he
incorporates Hanmer's glossary word for word, and almost
letter for letter. But his animosity betrays him in his
Preface. He complains of the trouble which he has been
put to by the last two editors, for he has had <span class="tei tei-q">“not only
their interpolations to throw out, but the genuine text to
replace and establish in its stead.”</span> He would not have
had this trouble had he used Pope's edition. He may
have believed that what he took from Hanmer and
Theobald was very much less than what they had received
from him. According to his own statements he supplied
each with a large number of important emendations which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelv">[pg lv]</span><a name="Pglv" id="Pglv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had been used without acknowledgment. Yet this does
not excuse the suggestion that his edition was founded on
Pope's.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The explanation is Warburton's just pride in Pope's
friendship,—a pride which he took every opportunity of
gratifying and parading. But in his earlier days he had
been, all unknown to Pope, an enemy. He escaped
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dunciad</span></span> by reason of his obscurity. He was the
friend of Concanen and Theobald, and in a letter to the
former, containing his earliest extant attempt at Shakespearian
criticism, he observes that <span class="tei tei-q">“Dryden borrows for
want of leisure, and Pope for want of genius.”</span> The
letter is dated 2nd January, 1726-27, but luckily for Warburton
it was not publicly known till, in 1766, Akenside
used it as a means of paying off old scores (see Nichols,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Illustrations</span></span>, ii., pp. 195-198, and Malone's Shakespeare,
1821, vol. xii., pp. 157, etc.). It is of interest also from
the fact that Theobald transcribed from it almost verbatim
the comparison of Shakespeare and Addison in the Preface
of 1733.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theobald's deference and even humility must have confirmed
Warburton's confidence in his own critical powers,
but it was not till Theobald's Shakespeare was published
that Warburton first hinted at an edition by himself.
From 1729 to 1733 he had given Theobald loyally of his
best. On the appearance of the edition he betrayed
some annoyance that all his suggestions had not been
accepted. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have transcribed about fifty emendations
and remarks,”</span> he writes on 17th May, 1734, <span class="tei tei-q">“which
I have at several times sent you, omitted in the Edition
of Shakespeare, which, I am sure, are better than any of
mine published there. These I shall convey to you soon,
and desire you to publish them (as omitted by being
mislaid) in your Edition of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Poems,’</span> which I hope
you will soon make ready for the press”</span> (Nichols,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Illustrations</span></span>, ii., p. 634). These he duly forwarded, along
with a flattering criticism of the edition. He gives no
hint that he may himself turn them to account, till the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelvi">[pg lvi]</span><a name="Pglvi" id="Pglvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
October of the same year, when he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have a
great number of notes, etc., on Shakespeare, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for some
future Edition</span></em>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">id.</span></span>, p. 654). Here the correspondence
ceases. Up to this time Warburton had aided Theobald's
schemes of retaliating on Pope. We have his own
authority for attributing to him the remark in Theobald's
Preface that <span class="tei tei-q">“it seems a moot point whether Mr. Pope
has done most injury to Shakespeare as his Editor and Encomiast,
or Mr. Rymer done him service as his Rival and
Censurer.”</span> It is probable even that he had a hand in
Theobald's and Concanen's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art of a Poet's sinking in
Reputation, or a Supplement to the Art of sinking in Poetry</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Warburton then gave his services to Sir Thomas
Hanmer. They had become acquainted by 1736, and
they corresponded frequently till Warburton's visit to
Mildenhall in May, 1737. It is needless to enter into
their quarrel, for the interest of it is purely personal.
Hanmer told his version of it to Joseph Smith, the Provost
of Queen's College, Oxford, in his letter of 28th October,
1742, and Warburton gave his very different account
nineteen years later, on 29th January, 1761, when he
discovered that Hanmer's letter was about to be published
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Biographia Britannica</span></span>. In the absence of further
evidence it is impossible to decide with whom the truth
rests. The dignity of Hanmer's letter wins favour by
contrast with the violence of Warburton's. Yet there
must be some truth in Warburton's circumstantial details,
though his feelings may have prevented his seeing them
in proper perspective. He says that Hanmer used
his notes without his knowledge. The statement is
probably accurate. But when Hanmer says that Warburton's
notes were <span class="tei tei-q">“sometimes just but mostly wild and
out of the way,”</span> we are satisfied, from what we know
of Warburton's other work, that the criticism was
merited. Hanmer apparently found that Warburton
did not give him much help, and Warburton may have
been annoyed at failing to find Hanmer as docile as
Theobald. They had quarrelled by September, 1739,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelvii">[pg lvii]</span><a name="Pglvii" id="Pglvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when Warburton records that he has got all his letters
and papers out of Sir Thomas Hanmer's hands (Nichols,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Illustrations</span></span>, ii. 110. See
also Nichols, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Literary Anecdotes</span></span>,
v. 588-590; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Biographia Britannica</span></span>, vol vi. (1763), pp.
3743-4, and appendix, p. 223; Philip Nichols, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Castrated
Letter of Sir Thomas Hanmer</span></span>, 1763; and Bunbury,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Correspondence of Hanmer</span></span>, pp. 85-90).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During his friendship with Hanmer, Warburton had
not lost sight of his own edition. The quarrel was precipitated
by Hanmer's discovery of Warburton's intention;
but there is no evidence that Warburton had tried to
conceal it. Everything goes to show that each editor
was so immersed in his own scheme that he regarded the
other as his collaborator. Hanmer did not know at
first that Warburton was planning an edition as a means
of making some money; and Warburton had not suspected
that Hanmer would publish an edition at all. This
is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from a letter
written by him to the Rev. Thomas Birch in October,
1737. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are pleased to enquire about Shakespeare,”</span>
he writes. <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe (to tell it as a secret) I shall, after
I have got the whole of this work out of my hands which
I am now engaged in, give an Edition of it to the world.
Sir Thomas Hanmer has a true critical genius, and has
done great things in this Author; so you may expect to
see a very extraordinary edition of its kind. I intend to
draw up and prefix to it a just and complete critique on
Shakespeare and his Works.”</span> This letter reads curiously
in the light of after events; but it proves, if it proves
anything, that Warburton did not suspect Hanmer's
scheme, and believed that Hanmer was helping him in his
edition. It is equally plain that Hanmer believed he
was being helped by Warburton.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Announcements of Warburton's forthcoming edition
were made in Birch's article on Shakespeare in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">General Dictionary, Historical and Critical</span></span>, vol. ix.,
January, 1739-40, and in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History of the Works of the
Learned</span></span> for 1740 (Nichols, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Illustrations</span></span>, ii., pp. 72-4,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelviii">[pg lviii]</span><a name="Pglviii" id="Pglviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lit. Anecdotes</span></span>, v., p. 559). But there were no signs
of its appearance, and Hanmer had good reason to say in
October, 1742, in his letter to Joseph Smith, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
satisfied there is no edition coming or likely to come
from Warburton; but it is a report raised to support
some little purpose or other, of which I see there are
many on foot.”</span> Up to this time Warburton had merely
suggested emendations and puzzled out explanations: he
had not set to work seriously on the complete text.
Since 1740, when he published the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vindication of the Essay
on Man</span></span>, his critical and polemical talents had been
devoted to the service of Pope. To judge from what he
says in his Preface, his project of an edition of Shakespeare
might have been abandoned had not Pope persuaded
him to proceed with it by the offer of making it appear
their joint work. Pope had nothing to do with it, for it
was not begun till after his death. But it was a cruel
fate that what professed to be a new edition of his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Shakespeare”</span> should really be founded on Theobald's.
The knowledge of Theobald's use of the Quartos and
Folios led Warburton to commit a detestable quibble on
his title-page. There is said to be no evidence that
Warburton himself had consulted them. Yet the statement
that his text is <span class="tei tei-q">“collated with all the former
editions”</span> is not absolutely without the bounds of truth:
Theobald had consulted them, and Warburton does not
say that he had consulted them himself. What Warburton
did was to give full play to his talent for
emendation, and to indulge what Johnson called his rage
for saying something when there is nothing to be said.
Yet we are too prone to depreciate Warburton. He
has prejudiced his reputation by his arrogance and his
contemptuous malignity; but we do him an injustice
if we endeavour to gauge his merit only by comparing
his edition with those of his immediate predecessors.
No early editor of Shakespeare has gained more than
Theobald and suffered more than Warburton by the
custom of attributing the whole merit of an edition to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelix">[pg lix]</span><a name="Pglix" id="Pglix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him whose name is on the title page. When we read
their correspondence and see their editions in the making,
it is not difficult to realise what Johnson meant when
he said that Warburton as a critic would make <span class="tei tei-q">“two
and fifty Theobalds, cut into slices.”</span>

Specimen.</span></span> As Warburton's edition was expected, this
anonymous scheme met with no encouragement, and
Johnson laid it aside till 1756, when he issued new Proposals.
In the interval he had written of Shakespeare in
the admirable Prologue which inaugurated Garrick's rule
at Drury Lane, and had shadowed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rambler</span></span> and
in the Dedication to Mrs. Lennox's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear Illustrated</span></span>
(1753) much of what was to appear in perfect form in
the Preface of 1765. It was one of the conditions in the
Proposals that the edition was to be published on or
before Christmas, 1757. As in the case of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dictionary</span></span>
Johnson underestimated the labour which such a work
involved. In December, 1757, we find him saying that
he will publish about March, and in March he says it will
be published before summer. He must have made considerable
progress at this time, as, according to his own
statement, <span class="tei tei-q">“many of the plays”</span> were then printed. But
its preparation was interrupted by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Idler</span></span> (April, 1758,
to April, 1760). Thereafter Johnson would appear to
have done little to it till he was awakened to activity by
the attack on him in Churchill's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ghost</span></span> (1763). The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelx">[pg lx]</span><a name="Pglx" id="Pglx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
edition at length appeared in October, 1765. <span class="tei tei-q">“In 1764
and 1765,”</span> says Boswell, <span class="tei tei-q">“it should seem that Dr.
Johnson was so busily employed with his edition of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> as to have had little leisure for any other
literary exertion, or indeed even for private correspondence.”</span>
The Preface was also published by itself
in 1765 with the title—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mr. Johnson's Preface to his
Edition of Shakespear's Plays</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The work immediately attracted great attention. Kenrick
lost no time in issuing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A Review of Doctor Johnson's
New Edition of Shakespeare: in which the Ignorance or
Inattention of that Editor is exposed, and the Poet defended
from the Persecution of his Commentators</span></span>, 1765. Johnson
was <span class="tei tei-q">“above answering for himself,”</span> but James Barclay,
an Oxford student, replied for him, to his annoyance, in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">An Examination of Mr. Kenrick's Review</span></span>, 1766, and
Kenrick himself rejoined in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A Defence of Mr. Kenrick's
Review ... By a Friend</span></span>, 1766. The most important
criticism of the edition was Tyrwhitt's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observations and
Conjectures upon some Passages of Shakespeare</span></span>, issued anonymously
by the Clarendon Press in 1766. Though we
read that <span class="tei tei-q">“the author has not entered into the merits of
Mr. Johnson's performance, but has set down some
observations and conjectures,”</span> the book is in effect an
examination of Johnson's edition. Notices appeared also
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monthly</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Critical Reviews</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London Magazine</span></span>,

Farmer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare</span></span> was published
at Cambridge early in January, 1767. In the
Preface to the second and enlarged edition, which
appeared in the same year, Farmer says that <span class="tei tei-q">“the few
who have been pleased to controvert any part of his
doctrine have favoured him with better manners than
arguments.”</span> This remark, like most of the Preface,
appears to be directed chiefly at the prejudiced notice
which appeared in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Critical Review</span></span> for January, 1767.
The writer of it was well versed in the controversy, for
he had expressed his opinion unhesitatingly in an earlier
number, and he lost no time in advancing new evidence in
opposition to Farmer's doctrine; but he only provided
Farmer with new proofs, which were at once incorporated
in the text of the Essay. The third edition, which was
called for in 1789, differs from the second only by the
inclusion of a short <span class="tei tei-q">“advertisement”</span> and a final note
explaining that Farmer had abandoned his intention of
publishing the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiquities of Leicester</span></span>. In the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Advertisement”</span> he admits that <span class="tei tei-q">“a few corrections might probably
be made, and many additional proofs of the argument
have necessarily occurred in more than twenty years”</span>;
but he did not think it necessary to make any changes.
He was content to leave the book in the hands of the
printers, and accordingly he is still described on the title-page
as <span class="tei tei-q">“Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge,”</span>
though he had succeeded to the mastership of his college
in 1775.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Farmer had, however, already supplemented his Essay
by a letter to Steevens, who printed it as an appendix to
his edition of Johnson's Shakespeare in 1773. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
track of reading,”</span> says Farmer, <span class="tei tei-q">“which I sometime ago
endeavoured to prove more immediately necessary to a
commentator on Shakespeare, you have very successfully
followed, and have consequently superseded some remarks

I now send you are such as I marked on the margin of
the copy you were so kind to communicate to me, and
bear a very small proportion to the miscellaneous collections
of this sort which I may probably put together some
time or other.”</span> Farmer did not carry out this intention,
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare</span></span> remains his
only independent publication.

have remained in manuscript, and been destroyed,
like his other critical works, at his death. On their
suggestion he revised and enlarged it, as hastily as he
had written it; and it appeared anonymously in the
spring of 1777. The original purpose of the Essay

John of Gaunt your grandfather, but yet no Coward,
Hal”</span>; but as Morgann wrote he passed from Falstaff to
the greater theme of Falstaff's creator. He was persuaded
to publish his Essay because, though it dealt
nominally with one character, its main subject was the art
of Shakespeare. For the same reason it finds a place
in this volume.

In 1744 Corbyn Morris had briefly analysed the
character of Falstaff in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay towards fixing the true
standards of Wit, Humour, Raillery, Satire, and Ridicule</span></span>;
Mrs. Montagu had expressed the common opinion of his
cowardice in her <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on the Writings and Genius of
Shakespeare</span></span>; the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Biographia Britannica</span></span> had declared him
to be Shakespeare's masterpiece; while his popularity had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxiii">[pg lxiii]</span><a name="Pglxiii" id="Pglxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
led Kenrick to produce in 1766 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff's Wedding</span></span> as a
sequel to the second part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry IV.</span></span>; but Morgann's
Essay is the first detailed examination of his character.
He was afterwards the subject of papers by Cumberland
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observer</span></span> (1785, No. 73), and by Henry Mackenzie
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lounger</span></span> (1786, Nos. 68, 69), and in 1789 he was
described by Richardson in an essay which reproduced
Morgann's title. None of these later works have the
interest attaching to James White's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff's Letters</span></span>
(1796).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on Falstaff</span></span> was republished, with a short
biographical preface, in 1820, and a third and last edition
came out in 1825. What is apparently the first detailed
criticism of it occurs in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London Review</span></span> for February,
1820.

It seems to be a kind of respect due to the memory of
excellent men, especially of those whom their wit and
learning have made famous, to deliver some account of
themselves, as well as their works, to Posterity. For this
reason, how fond do we see some people of discovering
any little personal story of the great men of Antiquity,
their families, the common accidents of their lives, and
even their shape, make, and features have been the subject
of critical enquiries. How trifling soever this Curiosity
may seem to be, it is certainly very natural; and we are
hardly satisfy'd with an account of any remarkable person,
'till we have heard him describ'd even to the very cloaths
he wears. As for what relates to men of letters, the
knowledge of an Author may sometimes conduce to the
better understanding his book: And tho' the Works of
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> may seem to many not to want a comment,
yet I fancy some little account of the man himself
may not be thought improper to go along with them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was the son of Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Shakespear</span></span>, and was born
at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span> upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Avon</span></span>,
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Warwickshire</span></span>, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">April</span></span> 1564.
His family, as appears by the Register and publick Writings
relating to that Town, were of good figure and fashion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there, and are mention'd as gentlemen. His father, who
was a considerable dealer in wool, had so large a family,
ten children in all, that tho' he was his eldest son, he
could give him no better education than his own employment.
He had bred him, 'tis true, for some time at a
Free-school, where 'tis probable he acquir'd that little <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span>
he was master of: But the narrowness of his circumstances,
and the want of his assistance at home, forc'd his father
to withdraw him from thence, and unhappily prevented his
further proficiency in that language. It is without controversie,
that he had no knowledge of the writings of the
antient poets, not only from this reason, but from his
works themselves, where we find no traces of any
thing that looks like an imitation of 'em; the delicacy
of his taste, and the natural bent of his own great
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genius</span></span>, equal, if not superior to some of the best of
theirs, would certainly have led him to read and study
'em with so much pleasure, that some of their fine images
would naturally have insinuated themselves into, and been
mix'd with his own writings; so that his not copying at
least something from them, may be an argument of his
never having read 'em. Whether his ignorance of the
Antients were a disadvantage to him or no, may admit of
a dispute: For tho' the knowledge of 'em might have
made him more correct, yet it is not improbable but that
the regularity and deference for them, which would have
attended that correctness, might have restrain'd some of
that fire, impetuosity, and even beautiful extravagance
which we admire in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>: And I believe we are
better pleas'd with those thoughts, altogether new and
uncommon, which his own imagination supply'd him so
abundantly with, than if he had given us the most beautiful
passages out of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> poets, and that in the
most agreeable manner that it was possible for a master of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> language to deliver
'em. Some <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> without
question he did know, and one may see up and down in
his Plays how far his reading that way went: In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Love's
Labour lost</span></span>, the Pedant comes out with a verse of

Grammar”</span>: which, I suppose, was the Author's case.
Whatever <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> he had, 'tis
certain he understood <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French</span></span>,
as may be observ'd from many words and sentences scatter'd
up and down his Plays in that language; and especially
from one scene in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Fifth written wholly in it.
Upon his leaving school, he seems to have given intirely
into that way of living which his father propos'd to him;
and in order to settle in the world after a family manner,
he thought fit to marry while he was yet very young. His
wife was the daughter of one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hathaway</span></span>, said to have been
a substantial yeoman in the neighbourhood of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>.
In this kind of settlement he continu'd for some time, 'till
an extravagance that he was guilty of forc'd him both out
of his country and that way of living which he had taken
up; and tho' it seem'd at first to be a blemish upon his
good manners, and a misfortune to him, yet it afterwards
happily prov'd the occasion of exerting one of the greatest
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genius</span></span>'s that ever was known in dramatick Poetry. He
had, by a misfortune common enough to young fellows,
fallen into ill company; and amongst them, some that
made a frequent practice of Deer-stealing, engag'd him
with them more than once in robbing a Park that belong'd
to Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas Lucy</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cherlecot</span></span> near <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>. For
this he was prosecuted by that gentleman, as he thought,
somewhat too severely; and in order to revenge that ill
usage, he made a ballad upon him. And tho' this, probably
the first essay of his Poetry, be lost, yet it is said to
have been so very bitter, that it redoubled the prosecution
against him to that degree, that he was oblig'd to leave
his business and family in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Warwickshire</span></span>, for some time,
and shelter himself in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is at this time, and upon this accident, that he is said
to have made his first acquaintance in the Play-house.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He was receiv'd into the Company then in being, at first
in a very mean rank; but his admirable wit, and the
natural turn of it to the stage, soon distinguish'd him, if
not as an extraordinary Actor, yet as an excellent Writer.
His name is printed, as the custom was in those times,
amongst those of the other Players, before some old
Plays, but without any particular account of what sort
of parts he us'd to play; and tho' I have inquir'd, I
could never meet with any further account of him this
way, than that the top of his Performance was the Ghost
in his own <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>. I should have been much more
pleas'd to have learn'd from some certain authority,
which was the first Play he wrote; it would be without
doubt a pleasure to any man, curious in things of this
kind, to see and know what was the first essay of a
fancy like <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s. Perhaps we are not to look for
his beginnings, like those of other authors, among their
least perfect writings; art had so little, and nature so
large a share in what he did, that, for ought I know, the
performances of his youth, as they were the most vigorous,
and had the most fire and strength of imagination in 'em,
were the best. I would not be thought by this to mean,
that his fancy was so loose and extravagant, as to be
independent on the rule and government of judgment;
but that what he thought, was commonly so great, so
justly and rightly conceiv'd in it self, that it wanted little
or no correction, and was immediately approv'd by an
impartial judgment at the first sight. Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dryden</span></span> seems
to think that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pericles</span></span> is one of his first Plays; but there
is no judgment to be form'd on that, since there is good
reason to believe that the greatest part of that Play was
not written by him; tho' it is own'd, some part of it
certainly was, particularly the last Act. But tho' the order
of time in which the several pieces were written be
generally uncertain, yet there are passages in some few
of them which seem to fix their dates. So the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chorus</span></span> in
the beginning of the fifth Act of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> V. by a compliment
very handsomly turn'd to the Earl of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essex</span></span>, shews
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Play to have been written when that Lord was General
for the Queen in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>: And his Elogy upon Q.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elizabeth</span></span>, and her successor
K. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James</span></span>, in the latter end
of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> VIII. is a proof of that Play's being written
after the accession of the latter of those two Princes to
the crown of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>. Whatever the particular times of
his writing were, the people of his age, who began to
grow wonderfully fond of diversions of this kind, could
not but be highly pleas'd to see a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genius</span></span> arise amongst
'em of so pleasurable, so rich a vein, and so plentifully
capable of furnishing their favourite entertainments.
Besides the advantages of his wit, he was in himself a
good-natur'd man, of great sweetness in his manners,
and a most agreeable companion; so that it is no wonder
if with so many good qualities he made himself acquainted
with the best conversations of those times. Queen
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elizabeth</span></span> had several of his Plays acted before her, and
without doubt gave him many gracious marks of her
favour: It is that maiden Princess plainly, whom he
intends by

And that whole passage is a compliment very properly
brought in, and very handsomely apply'd to her. She
was so well pleas'd with that admirable character of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, in the two
parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Fourth, that she
commanded him to continue it for one Play more, and
to shew him in love. This is said to be the occasion of
his writing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Merry Wives of</span></span> Windsor. How well she
was obey'd, the play it self is an admirable proof. Upon
this occasion it may not be improper to observe, that this
part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is said to have been written originally
under the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oldcastle</span></span>; some of that family being
then remaining, the Queen was pleas'd to command him
to alter it; upon which he made use of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>. The
present offence was indeed avoided; but I don't know
whether the Author may not have been somewhat to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
blame in his second choice, since it is certain that Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John
Falstaff</span></span>, who was a Knight of the Garter, and a Lieutenant-general,
was a name of distinguish'd merit in the wars in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span>
the Fifth's and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Sixth's times.
What grace soever the Queen conferr'd upon him, it was
not to her only he ow'd the fortune which the reputation
of his wit made. He had the honour to meet with many
great and uncommon marks of favour and friendship
from the Earl of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Southampton</span></span>, famous in the histories of
that time for his friendship to the unfortunate Earl of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essex</span></span>. It was to that noble Lord that he dedicated his
Poem of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Venus</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adonis</span></span>, the only piece of his Poetry
which he ever publish'd himself, tho' many of his Plays
were surrepticiously and lamely printed in his life-time.
There is one instance so singular in the magnificence
of this Patron of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s, that if I had not been
assur'd that the story was handed down by Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William
D'Avenant</span></span>, who was probably very well acquainted with
his affairs, I should not have ventur'd to have inserted,
that my Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Southampton</span></span> at one time gave him a thousand
pounds, to enable him to go through with a purchase which
he heard he had a mind to: A bounty very great, and
very rare at any time, and almost equal to that profuse
generosity the present age has shewn to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French</span></span> Dancers
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Italian</span></span> Eunuchs.

What particular habitude or friendships he contracted
with private men, I have not been able to learn, more
than that every one who had a true taste of merit, and
could distinguish men, had generally a just value and
esteem for him. His exceeding candor and good nature
must certainly have inclin'd all the gentler part of the

his reputation in Poetry must have been great enough
before that time to have deserv'd what is here said of him.
His acquaintance with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span> began with a remarkable
piece of humanity and good nature; Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Johnson</span></span>, who was at that time altogether unknown to
the world, had offer'd one of his Plays to the Players,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in order to have it acted; and the persons into whose
hands it was put, after having turn'd it carelessly and
superciliously over, were just upon returning it to him
with an ill-natur'd answer, that it would be of no service
to their Company, when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> luckily cast his eye
upon it, and found something so well in it as to engage
him first to read it through, and afterwards to recommend
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Johnson</span></span> and his writings to the publick. After
this they were profess'd friends; tho' I don't know
whether the other ever made him an equal return of gentleness
and sincerity. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben</span></span> was naturally proud and insolent,
and in the days of his reputation did so far take
upon him the supremacy in wit, that he could not but
look with an evil eye upon any one that seem'd to stand
in competition with him. And if at times he has affected
to commend him, it has always been with some reserve,
insinuating his uncorrectness, a careless manner of writing,
and want of judgment; the praise of seldom altering or
blotting out what he writ, which was given him by the
Players who were the first Publishers of his Works after
his death, was what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Johnson</span></span> could not bear; he thought
it impossible, perhaps, for another man to strike out the
greatest thoughts in the finest expression, and to reach
those excellencies of Poetry with the ease of a first
imagination, which himself with infinite labour and
study could but hardly attain to. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Johnson</span></span> was certainly
a very good scholar, and in that had the advantage
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>; tho' at the same time I believe it
must be allow'd, that what Nature gave the latter, was
more than a ballance for what Books had given the
former; and the judgment of a great man upon this
occasion was, I think, very just and proper. In a conversation
between Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Suckling</span></span>,
Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William D'Avenant</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Endymion Porter</span></span>, Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hales</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eaton</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span>;
Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Suckling</span></span>, who
was a profess'd admirer of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>,
had undertaken his defence against <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span>
with some warmth; Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hales</span></span>, who had sat still for some
time, hearing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben</span></span> frequently reproaching him with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
want of learning, and ignorance of the Antients, told him
at last, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That if Mr.</span></em> Shakespear <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had not read the Antients,
he had likewise not stollen any thing from 'em</span></em> (a fault the
other made no conscience of); <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and that if he would produce
any one Topick finely treated by any one of them, he would
undertake to shew something upon the same subject at least as
well written by</span></em> Shakespear. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Johnson</span></span> did indeed take a
large liberty, even to the transcribing and translating of
whole scenes together; and sometimes, with all deference
to so great a name as his, not altogether for the advantage
of the authors of whom he borrow'd. And if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Augustus</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Virgil</span></span> were really what he has made 'em in a scene of
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poetaster</span></span>, they are as odd an Emperor and a Poet as
ever met. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, on the other hand, was beholding
to no body farther than the foundation of the tale, the
incidents were often his own, and the writing intirely so.
There is one Play of his, indeed, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Comedy of Errors</span></span>, in
a great measure taken from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menæchmi</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span>.
How that happen'd, I cannot easily divine, since, as I
hinted before, I do not take him to have been master of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> enough to read it in the original, and I know of no
translation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span> so old as his time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As I have not propos'd to my self to enter into a large
and compleat criticism upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s Works, so I suppose
it will neither be expected that I should take notice
of the severe remarks that have been formerly made upon
him by Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rhymer</span></span>. I must confess, I can't very well
see what could be the reason of his animadverting with so
much sharpness, upon the faults of a man excellent on
most occasions, and whom all the world ever was and will
be inclin'd to have an esteem and veneration for. If it
was to shew his own knowledge in the Art of Poetry,
besides that there is a vanity in making that only his
design, I question if there be not many imperfections as
well in those schemes and precepts he has given for the
direction of others, as well as in that sample of Tragedy
which he has written to shew the excellency of his own
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genius</span></span>. If he had a pique against the man, and wrote on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
purpose to ruin a reputation so well establish'd, he has
had the mortification to fail altogether in his attempt, and
to see the world at least as fond of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> as of his
Critique. But I won't believe a gentleman, and a good-natur'd
man, capable of the last intention. Whatever
may have been his meaning, finding fault is certainly the
easiest task of knowledge, and commonly those men of
good judgment, who are likewise of good and gentle
dispositions, abandon this ungrateful province to the
tyranny of pedants. If one would enter into the beauties
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, there is a much larger, as well as a more
delightful field; but as I won't prescribe to the tastes of
other people, so I will only take the liberty, with all
due submission to the judgments of others, to observe
some of those things I have been pleas'd with in looking
him over.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His Plays are properly to be distinguish'd only into
Comedies and Tragedies. Those which are called Histories,
and even some of his Comedies, are really Tragedies,
with a run or mixture of Comedy amongst 'em. That
way of Trage-comedy was the common mistake of that
age, and is indeed become so agreeable to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span>
taste, that tho' the severer Critiques among us cannot bear
it, yet the generality of our audiences seem to be better
pleas'd with it than with an exact Tragedy. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Merry
Wives of</span></span> Windsor, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Comedy
of Errors</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Taming
of the Shrew</span></span>, are all pure Comedy; the rest, however they
are call'd, have something of both kinds. 'Tis not very
easy to determine which way of writing he was most
excellent in. There is certainly a great deal of entertainment
in his comical humours; and tho' they did not then
strike at all ranks of people, as the Satyr of the present
age has taken the liberty to do, yet there is a pleasing and
a well-distinguish'd variety in those characters which he
thought fit to meddle with. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is allow'd by every
body to be a master-piece; the Character is always well-sustain'd,
tho' drawn out into the length of three
Plays; and even the account of his death, given by his old
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
landlady Mrs. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quickly</span></span>, in
the first act of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> V., tho' it
be extremely natural, is yet as diverting as any part of his
life. If there be any fault in the draught he has made of
this lewd old fellow, it is, that tho' he has made him a
thief, lying, cowardly, vain-glorious, and in short every
way vicious, yet he has given him so much wit as to make
him almost too agreeable; and I don't know whether
some people have not, in remembrance of the diversion he
had formerly afforded 'em, been sorry to see his friend
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hal</span></span> use him so scurvily, when he comes to the crown in
the end of the second part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Fourth.
Amongst other extravagances, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Merry Wives of</span></span>
Windsor, he has made him a Deer-stealer, that he might
at the same time remember his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Warwickshire</span></span> prosecutor,
under the name of Justice <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>; he has given him very
near the same coat of arms which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dugdale</span></span>, in his Antiquities
of that county, describes for a family there, and makes
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Welsh</span></span> parson descant very pleasantly upon 'em. That
whole play is admirable; the humours are various and
well oppos'd; the main design, which is to cure <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ford</span></span> of
his unreasonable jealousie, is extremely well conducted.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apemantus</span></span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Timon</span></span>,
will be allow'd to be master-pieces of
ill nature and satyrical snarling. To these I might add
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that incomparable character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shylock</span></span>
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jew</span></span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Merchant
of</span></span> Venice; but tho' we have seen that play receiv'd
and acted as a Comedy, and the part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jew</span></span> perform'd
by an excellent Comedian, yet I cannot but think it was
design'd tragically by the Author. There appears in it
such a deadly spirit of revenge, such a savage fierceness
and fellness, and such a bloody designation of cruelty and
mischief, as cannot agree either with the stile or characters
of Comedy. The Play it self, take it all together, seems
to me to be one of the most finish'd of any of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s.
The tale indeed, in that part relating to the caskets, and
the extravagant and unusual kind of bond given by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antonio</span></span>,
is a little too much remov'd from the rules of probability:
But taking the fact for granted, we must allow it to be
very beautifully written. There is something in the friendship
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antonio</span></span> to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bassanio</span></span> very great, generous, and
tender. The whole fourth act, supposing, as I said, the
fact to be probable, is extremely fine. But there are two
passages that deserve a particular notice. The first is,
what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Portia</span></span> says in praise of mercy, and the other on the
power of musick. The melancholy of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jaques</span></span>, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As you

commonly sprightly and pleasing, except in those places

his jingling sometimes, and playing upon words, it was the

of some of the gravest Divines of those times; perhaps
it may not be thought too light for the Stage.

But certainly the greatness of this Author's genius do's
no where so much appear, as where he gives his imagination
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an entire loose, and raises his fancy to a flight above
mankind and the limits of the visible world. Such are his
attempts in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Tempest</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midsummer Nights Dream</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>. Of these,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Tempest</span></span>, however it comes
to be plac'd the first by the former publishers of his works,
can never have been the first written by him: It seems to
me as perfect in its kind, as almost any thing we have of
his. One may observe, that the Unities are kept here,
with an exactness uncommon to the liberties of his
writing; tho' that was what, I suppose, he valu'd himself
least upon, since his excellencies were all of another kind.
I am very sensible that he do's, in this play, depart too
much from that likeness to truth which ought to be
observ'd in these sort of writings; yet he do's it so very
finely, that one is easily drawn in to have more faith for
his sake, than reason does well allow of. His Magick has
something in it very solemn and very poetical: And that
extravagant character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Caliban</span></span> is mighty well sustain'd,
shews a wonderful invention in the Author, who could
strike out such a particular wild image, and is certainly
one of the finest and most uncommon Grotesques that
was ever seen. The observation, which I have been
inform'd<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> three very great men concurr'd in making upon
this part, was extremely just: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> Shakespear <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had not
only found out a new Character in his</span></em> Caliban, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but had also
devis'd and adapted a new manner of Language for that
Character</span></em>. Among the particular beauties of this piece, I
think one may be allow'd to point out the tale of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prospero</span></span>
in the first Act; his speech to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ferdinand</span></span> in the fourth,
upon the breaking up the masque of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Juno</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ceres</span></span>; and
that in the fifth, when he dissolves his charms, and resolves
to break his magick rod. This Play has been alter'd by
Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William D'Avenant</span></span> and
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dryden</span></span>; and tho' I won't
arraign the judgment of those two great men, yet I think I
may be allow'd to say, that there are some things left out
by them, that might, and even ought to have been kept in.
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dryden</span></span> was an admirer of our Author, and, indeed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he owed him a great deal, as those who have read them
both may very easily observe. And, I think, in justice to
'em both, I should not on this occasion omit what Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dryden</span></span> has said of him.

It is the same magick that raises the Fairies in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midsummer
Night's Dream</span></span>, the Witches in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span>, and the
Ghost in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>, with thoughts and language so proper to
the parts they sustain, and so peculiar to the talent of this
Writer. But of the two last of these Plays I shall have
occasion to take notice, among the Tragedies of Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>. If one undertook to examine the greatest
part of these by those rules which are establish'd by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>, and taken from
the model of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grecian</span></span> stage, it
would be no very hard task to find a great many faults:
But as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> liv'd under a kind of mere light of nature,
and had never been made acquainted with the regularity
of those written precepts, so it would be hard to judge
him by a law he knew nothing of. We are to consider
him as a man that liv'd in a state of almost universal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
licence and ignorance: There was no establish'd judge, but
every one took the liberty to write according to the
dictates of his own fancy. When one considers that
there is not one play before him of a reputation good
enough to entitle it to an appearance on the present
Stage, it cannot but be a matter of great wonder that
he should advance dramatick Poetry so far as he did.
The Fable is what is generally plac'd the first, among those
that are reckon'd the constituent parts of a Tragick or
Heroick Poem; not, perhaps, as it is the most difficult
or beautiful, but as it is the first properly to be thought of
in the contrivance and course of the whole; and with the
Fable ought to be consider'd the fit Disposition, Order,
and Conduct of its several parts. As it is not in this
province of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Drama</span></span> that the strength and mastery of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> lay, so I shall not undertake the tedious and
ill-natur'd trouble to point out the several faults he was
guilty of in it. His Tales were seldom invented, but
rather taken either from true History, or Novels and
Romances: And he commonly made use of 'em in that
order, with those incidents, and that extent of time in
which he found 'em in the Authors from whence he
borrow'd them. So <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Winter's Tale</span></span>, which is taken
from an old book, call'd <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Delectable History of</span></span> Dorastus
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> Faunia, contains the space of sixteen or seventeen
years, and the Scene is sometimes laid in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bohemia</span></span>, and
sometimes in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sicily</span></span>, according to the original order of the
Story. Almost all his historical Plays comprehend a great
length of time, and very different and distinct places:
And in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antony</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cleopatra</span></span>,
the Scene travels over the
greatest part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> empire. But in recompence
for his carelessness in this point, when he comes to another
part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Drama, The Manners of his Characters, in acting
or speaking what is proper for them, and fit to be shown by the
Poet</span></span>, he may be generally justify'd, and in very many
places greatly commended. For those Plays which he has
taken from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> history, let any man
compare 'em, and he will find the character as exact in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Poet as the Historian. He seems indeed so far from
proposing to himself any one action for a Subject, that the
Title very often tells you, 'tis <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Life of King</span></span>
John, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King</span></span>
Richard, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">&amp;c.</span></span> What can be more agreeable to the idea
our historians give of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> the Sixth, than the picture
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> has drawn of him! His Manners are every
where exactly the same with the story; one finds him still
describ'd with simplicity, passive sanctity, want of courage,
weakness of mind, and easie submission to the governance
of an imperious Wife, or prevailing Faction: Tho' at the
same time the Poet do's justice to his good qualities, and
moves the pity of his audience for him, by showing him
pious, disinterested, a contemner of the things of this
world, and wholly resign'd to the severest dispensations of
God's providence. There is a short Scene in the second
part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> VI., which I cannot but think admirable
in its kind. Cardinal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beaufort</span></span>, who had murder'd the
Duke of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>, is shewn in the last agonies on his
death-bed, with the good King praying over him. There
is so much terror in one, so much tenderness and moving
piety in the other, as must touch any one who is capable
either of fear or pity. In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> VIII. that Prince is
drawn with that greatness of mind, and all those good
qualities which are attributed to him in any account of his
reign. If his faults are not shewn in an equal degree, and
the shades in this picture do not bear a just proportion to
the lights, it is not that the Artist wanted either colours or
skill in the disposition of 'em; but the truth, I believe,
might be, that he forbore doing it out of regard to Queen
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elizabeth</span></span>, since it could have been no very great respect
to the memory of his Mistress, to have expos'd some
certain parts of her father's life upon the stage. He has
dealt much more freely with the Minister of that great
King, and certainly nothing was ever more justly written,
than the character of Cardinal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wolsey</span></span>. He has shewn
him tyrannical, cruel, and insolent in his prosperity;
and yet, by a wonderful address, he makes his fall
and ruin the subject of general compassion. The whole
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man, with his vices and virtues, is finely and exactly
describ'd in the second Scene of the fourth Act. The
distresses likewise of Queen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Katherine</span></span>, in this Play, are
very movingly touch'd; and tho' the art of the Poet
has skreen'd King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> from any gross imputation of
injustice, yet one is inclin'd to wish, the Queen had met
with a fortune more worthy of her birth and virtue. Nor
are the Manners, proper to the persons represented, less
justly observ'd in those characters taken from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span>
History; and of this, the fierceness and impatience of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>, his courage and disdain of the common people,
the virtue and philosophical temper of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span>, and the
irregular greatness of mind in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">M. Antony</span></span>, are beautiful
proofs. For the two last especially, you find 'em exactly
as they are describ'd by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plutarch</span></span>, from whom certainly
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> copy'd 'em. He has indeed follow'd his
original pretty close, and taken in several little incidents
that might have been spar'd in a Play. But, as I hinted
before, his design seems most commonly rather to describe
those great men in the several fortunes and accidents of their
lives, than to take any single great action, and form his
work simply upon that. However, there are some of his
pieces, where the Fable is founded upon one action only.
Such are more especially, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romeo</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Juliet</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Othello</span></span>. The design in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romeo</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Juliet</span></span> is plainly the
punishment of their two families, for the unreasonable
feuds and animosities that had been so long kept up
between 'em, and occasion'd the effusion of so much
blood. In the management of this story, he has shewn
something wonderfully tender and passionate in the love-part,
and very pitiful in the distress. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> is founded
on much the same Tale with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Electra</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sophocles</span></span>. In
each of 'em a young Prince is engag'd to revenge the
death of his father, their mothers are equally guilty, are
both concern'd in the murder of their husbands, and are
afterwards married to the murderers. There is in the
first part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></span> Tragedy, something very moving in
the grief of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Electra</span></span>; but as
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">D'Acier</span></span> has observ'd,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there is something very unnatural and shocking in the
Manners he has given that Princess and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orestes</span></span> in the
latter part. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orestes</span></span> embrues his hands in the blood of his
own mother; and that barbarous action is perform'd, tho'
not immediately upon the stage, yet so near, that the
audience hear <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clytemnestra</span></span>
crying out to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ægysthus</span></span> for help,
and to her son for mercy: While <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Electra</span></span>, her daughter,
and a Princess, both of them characters that ought to
have appear'd with more decency, stands upon the stage
and encourages her brother in the parricide. What horror
does this not raise! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clytemnestra</span></span> was a wicked woman,
and had deserv'd to die; nay, in the truth of the story, she
was kill'd by her own son; but to represent an action of
this kind on the stage, is certainly an offence against those
rules of manners proper to the persons, that ought to be
observ'd there. On the contrary, let us only look a little
on the conduct of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> is represented with
the same piety towards his father, and resolution to
revenge his death, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orestes</span></span>; he has the same abhorrence
for his mother's guilt, which, to provoke him the more, is
heighten'd by incest: But 'tis with wonderful art and
justness of judgment, that the Poet restrains him from
doing violence to his mother. To prevent any thing of
that kind, he makes his father's Ghost forbid that part of
his vengeance.

This is to distinguish rightly between
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horror</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span>.
The latter is a proper passion of Tragedy, but the former
ought always to be carefully avoided. And certainly no
dramatick Writer ever succeeded better in raising <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span> in
the minds of an audience than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> has done. The
whole Tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span>, but more especially the scene
where the King is murder'd, in the second Act, as well as
this Play, is a noble proof of that manly spirit with which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he writ; and both shew how powerful he was, in giving the
strongest motions to our souls that they are capable of. I
cannot leave <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> without taking notice of the advantage
with which we have seen this Master-piece of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
distinguish it self upon the stage, by Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Betterton</span></span>'s fine
performance of that part: A man who, tho' he had no
other good qualities, as he has a great many, must have
made his way into the esteem of all men of letters, by this
only excellency. No man is better acquainted with
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s manner of expression, and indeed he has
study'd him so well, and is so much a master of him, that
whatever part of his he performs, he does it as if it had
been written on purpose for him, and that the Author had
exactly conceiv'd it as he plays it. I must own a particular
obligation to him, for the most considerable part of the
passages relating to this life, which I have here transmitted
to the publick; his veneration for the memory of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
having engaged him to make a journey into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Warwickshire</span></span>,
on purpose to gather up what remains he could
of a name for which he had so great a value. Since I had
at first resolv'd not to enter into any critical controversie,
I won't pretend to enquire into the justness of Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rhymer</span></span>'s Remarks on
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Othello</span></span>; he has certainly pointed
out some faults very judiciously; and indeed they are
such as most people will agree, with him, to be faults:
But I wish he would likewise have observ'd some of
the beauties too; as I think it became an exact and
equal Critique to do. It seems strange that he should
allow nothing good in the whole: If the Fable and
Incidents are not to his taste, yet the Thoughts are almost
every where very noble, and the Diction manly and
proper. These last, indeed, are parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s
praise, which it would be very hard to dispute with him.
His Sentiments and Images of things are great and
natural; and his Expression (tho' perhaps in some
instances a little irregular) just, and rais'd in proportion
to his subject and occasion. It would be even endless to
mention the particular instances that might be given of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this kind: But his Book is in the possession of the publick,
and 'twill be hard to dip into any part of it, without
finding what I have said of him made good.

The latter part of his life was spent, as all men of
good sense will wish theirs may be, in ease, retirement,
and the conversation of his friends. He had the good
fortune to gather an estate equal to his occasion, and, in
that, to his wish; and is said to have spent some years
before his death at his native <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>. His pleasurable
wit, and good nature, engag'd him in the acquaintance,
and entitled him to the friendship of the gentlemen of

still remember'd in that country, that he had a particular
intimacy with Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Combe</span></span>, an old gentleman noted thereabouts

to out-live him; and since he could not know what might
be said of him when he was dead, he desir'd it might be
done immediately: Upon which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> gave him these
four verses.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I here send you the Tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>, which I have
alter'd from the Original of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, and with it a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was one of the greatest Genius's that the
World e'er saw for the Tragick Stage. Tho' he lay
under greater Disadvantages than any of his Successors,
yet had he greater and more genuine Beauties than the
best and greatest of them. And what makes the brightest
Glory of his Character, those Beauties were entirely his
own, and owing to the Force of his own Nature; whereas
his Faults were owing to his Education, and to the Age
that he liv'd in. One may say of him as they did of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homer</span></span>, that he had none to imitate, and is himself inimitable.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
His Imaginations were often as just, as they were
bold and strong. He had a natural Discretion which
never cou'd have been taught him, and his Judgment was
strong and penetrating. He seems to have wanted
nothing but Time and Leisure for Thought, to have
found out those Rules of which he appears so ignorant.
His Characters are always drawn justly, exactly, graphically,
except where he fail'd by not knowing History or
the Poetical Art. He has for the most part more fairly
distinguish'd them than any of his Successors have done,
who have falsified them, or confounded them, by making
Love the predominant Quality in all. He had so fine a
Talent for touching the Passions, and they are so lively
in him, and so truly in Nature, that they often touch us
more without their due Preparations, than those of other
Tragick Poets, who have all the Beauty of Design and all
the Advantage of Incidents. His Master-Passion was
Terror, which he has often mov'd so powerfully and so
wonderfully, that we may justly conclude, that if he had
had the Advantage of Art and Learning, he wou'd have
surpass'd the very best and strongest of the Ancients. His
Paintings are often so beautiful and so lively, so graceful
and so powerful, especially where he uses them in order
to move Terror, that there is nothing perhaps more
accomplish'd in our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Poetry. His Sentiments for
the most part in his best Tragedies, are noble, generous,
easie, and natural, and adapted to the Persons who use
them. His Expression is in many Places good and pure
after a hundred Years; simple tho' elevated, graceful
tho' bold, and easie tho' strong. He seems to have been
the very Original of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Tragical Harmony; that
is the Harmony of Blank Verse, diversifyed often by
Dissyllable and Trissyllable Terminations. For that
Diversity distinguishes it from Heroick Harmony, and,
bringing it nearer to common Use, makes it more proper
to gain Attention, and more fit for Action and Dialogue.
Such Verse we make when we are writing Prose; we
make such Verse in common Conversation.

If <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> had these great Qualities by Nature, what
would he not have been, if he had join'd to so happy a
Genius Learning and the Poetical Art? For want of the
latter, our Author has sometimes made gross Mistakes in
the Characters which he has drawn from History, against
the Equality and Conveniency of Manners of his Dramatical
Persons. Witness <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menenius</span></span> in the following
Tragedy, whom he has made an errant Buffoon, which is
a great Absurdity. For he might as well have imagin'd
a grave majestick <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jack-Pudding</span></span>,
as a Buffoon in a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span>
Senator. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aufidius</span></span> the General
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volscians</span></span> is shewn a
base and a profligate Villain. He has offended against the
Equality of the Manners even in his Hero himself. For
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> who in the first part of the Tragedy is shewn
so open, so frank, so violent, and so magnanimous, is
represented in the latter part by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aufidius</span></span>, which is
contradicted by no one, a flattering, fawning, cringing,
insinuating Traytor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For want of this Poetical Art, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> has introduced
things into his Tragedies, which are against the
Dignity of that noble Poem, as the Rabble in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Julius
Cæsar</span></span>, and that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>;
tho' that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>
offends not only against the Dignity of Tragedy, but
against the Truth of History likewise, and the Customs
of Ancient <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>, and the
Majesty of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> People,
as we shall have occasion to shew anon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For want of this Art, he has made his Incidents less
moving, less surprizing, and less wonderful. He has
been so far from seeking those fine Occasions to move
with which an Action furnish'd according to Art would
have furnish'd him, that he seems rather to have industriously
avoided them. He makes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>, upon his
Sentence of Banishment, take his leave of his Wife
and his Mother out of sight of the Audience, and so
has purposely as it were avoided a great occasion to
move.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we are willing to allow that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, by sticking
to the bare Events of History, has mov'd more than any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his Successors, yet his just Admirers must confess,
that if he had had the Poetical Art, he would have mov'd
ten times more. For 'tis impossible that by a bare Historical
Play he could move so much as he would have
done by a Fable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We find that a Romance entertains the generality of
Mankind with more Satisfaction than History, if they read
only to be entertain'd; but if they read History thro'
Pride or Ambition, they bring their Passions along with
them, and that alters the case. Nothing is more plain
than that even in an Historical Relation some Parts of it,
and some Events, please more than others. And therefore
a Man of Judgment, who sees why they do so, may
in forming a Fable, and disposing an Action, please more
than an Historian can do. For the just Fiction of a Fable
moves us more than an Historical Relation can do, for the
two following Reasons: First, by reason of the Communication
and mutual Dependence of its Parts. For if
Passion springs from Motion, then the Obstruction of
that Motion or a counter Motion must obstruct and check
the Passion: And therefore an Historian and a Writer of
Historical Plays, passing from Events of one nature to
Events of another nature without a due Preparation, must
of necessity stifle and confound one Passion by another.
The second Reason why the Fiction of a Fable pleases us
more than an Historical Relation can do, is, because in an
Historical Relation we seldom are acquainted with the true
Causes of Events, whereas in a feign'd Action which is duly
constituted, that is, which has a just beginning, those
Causes always appear. For 'tis observable, that, both in a
Poetical Fiction and an Historical Relation, those Events
are the most entertaining, the most surprizing, and the
most wonderful, in which Providence most plainly appears.
And 'tis for this Reason that the Author of a just Fable
must please more than the Writer of an Historical Relation.
The Good must never fail to prosper, and the Bad
must be always punish'd: Otherwise the Incidents, and
particularly the Catastrophe which is the grand Incident,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are liable to be imputed rather to Chance, than to
Almighty Conduct and to Sovereign Justice. The want
of this impartial Distribution of Justice makes the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> to be without Moral. 'Tis true indeed
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> is kill'd by those Foreign Enemies with whom
he had openly sided against his Country, which seems to
be an Event worthy of Providence, and would look as if
it were contriv'd by infinite Wisdom, and executed by
supreme Justice, to make <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> a dreadful Example
to all who lead on Foreign Enemies to the Invasion of
their native Country; if there were not something in the
Fate of the other Characters, which gives occasion to
doubt of it, and which suggests to the Sceptical Reader
that this might happen by accident. For <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aufidius</span></span> the
principal Murderer of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>, who in cold Blood gets
him assassinated by Ruffians, instead of leaving him to the
Law of the Country, and the Justice of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volscian</span></span>
Senate, and who commits so black a Crime, not by any
erroneous Zeal, or a mistaken publick Spirit, but thro'
Jealousy, Envy, and inveterate Malice; this Assassinator
not only survives, and survives unpunish'd, but seems to
be rewarded for so detestable an Action, by engrossing
all those Honours to himself which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> before had
shar'd with him. But not only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aufidius</span></span>,
but the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span>
Tribunes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sicinius</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span>, appear to me to cry aloud
for Poetick Vengeance. For they are guilty of two
Faults, neither of which ought to go unpunish'd: The
first in procuring the Banishment of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>. If they
were really jealous that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> had a Design on their
Liberties, when he stood for the Consulship, it was but
just that they should give him a Repulse; but to get the
Champion and Defender of their Country banish'd upon
a pretended Jealousy was a great deal too much, and could
proceed from nothing but that Hatred and Malice which
they had conceiv'd against him, for opposing their Institution.
Their second Fault lay in procuring this Sentence
by indirect Methods, by exasperating and inflaming the
People by Artifices and Insinuations, by taking a base
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Advantage of the Open-heartedness and Violence of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>,
and by oppressing him with a Sophistical Argument,
that he aim'd at Sovereignty, because he had
not delivered into the Publick Treasury the Spoils which
he had taken from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiates</span></span>. As if a Design of
Sovereignty could be reasonably concluded from any one
Act; or any one could think of bringing to pass such a
Design, by eternally favouring the Patricians, and disobliging
the Populace. For we need make no doubt but
that it was among the young Patricians that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>
distributed the Spoils which were taken from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiates</span></span>;
whereas nothing but caressing the Populace could enslave
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> People, as
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> afterwards very well saw and
experienc'd. So that this Injustice of the Tribunes was
the original Cause of the Calamity which afterwards befel
their Country, by the Invasion of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volscians</span></span>, under
the Conduct of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>. And yet these Tribunes
at the end of the Play, like <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aufidius</span></span>, remain unpunish'd.
But indeed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> has been wanting in the
exact Distribution of Poetical Justice not only in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>, but in most of his best Tragedies, in which
the Guilty and the Innocent perish promiscuously; as

the Tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>. For tho' it may be said in
Defence of the last, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> had a Design to kill
his Uncle who then reign'd; yet this is justify'd by no
less than a Call from Heaven, and raising up one from
the Dead to urge him to it. The Good and the Bad then
perishing promiscuously in the best of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s
Tragedies, there can be either none or very weak Instruction
in them: For such promiscuous Events call the
Government of Providence into Question, and by
Scepticks and Libertines are resolv'd into Chance. I
humbly conceive therefore that this want of Dramatical
Justice in the Tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> gave occasion for a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
just Alteration, and that I was oblig'd to sacrifice to that
Justice <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aufidius</span></span> and the Tribunes,
as well as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus have we endeavour'd to shew that, for want of
the Poetical Art, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> lay under very great Disadvantages.
At the same time we must own to his Honour,
that he has often perform'd Wonders without it, in spight
of the Judgment of so great a Man as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horace</span></span>.

But from this very Judgment of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horace</span></span> we may justly conclude
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> would have wonderfully surpass'd
himself, if Art had been join'd to Nature. There never
was a greater Genius in the World than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Virgil</span></span>: He was
one who seems to have been born for this glorious End,
that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Muse might exert in him the utmost Force
of her Poetry: And his admirable and divine Beauties
are manifestly owing to the happy Confederacy of Art
and Nature. It was Art that contriv'd that incomparable
Design of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Æneis</span></span>, and it was Nature that executed it.
Could the greatest Genius that ever was infus'd into
Earthly Mold by Heaven, if it had been unguided and
unassisted by Art, have taught him to make that noble
and wonderful Use of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pythagorean</span></span> Transmigration,
which he makes in the Sixth Book of his Poem? Had
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Virgil</span></span> been a circular Poet, and closely adher'd to History,
how could the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span> have been transported with
that inimitable Episode of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dido</span></span>, which brought a-fresh
into their Minds the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carthaginian</span></span> War, and the dreadful
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hannibal</span></span>? When 'tis evident that that admirable
Episode is so little owing to a faithful observance of
History, and the exact order of Time, that 'tis deriv'd
from a very bold but judicious Violation of these; it
being undeniable that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dido</span></span> liv'd almost 300 Years after
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Æneas</span></span>. Yet is it that charming Episode that makes the
chief Beauties of a third Part of the Poem. For the
Destruction of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Troy</span></span> it self, which is so divinely related, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still more admirable by the Effect it produces, which is
the Passion of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dido</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon the Encouragement I have receiv'd from you, I
shall proceed to shew under what Disadvantages <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
lay for want of being conversant with the Ancients.
But because I have lately been in some Conversation,
where they would not allow but that he was acquainted
with the Ancients, I shall endeavour to make it appear
that he was not; and the shewing that in the Method
in which I pretend to convince the Reader of it, will
sufficiently prove what Inconveniencies he lay under, and
what Errors he committed for want of being conversant
with them. But here we must distinguish between the
several kinds of Acquaintance: A Man may be said to
be acquainted with another who never was but twice in his
Company; but that is at the best a superficial Acquaintance,
from which neither very great Pleasure nor Profit
can be deriv'd. Our Business is here to shew that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> had no
familiar Acquaintance with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Græcian</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Authors. For if he was familiarly conversant
with them, how comes it to pass that he wants Art? Is it
that he studied to know them in other things, and
neglected that only in them, which chiefly tends to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Advancement of the Art of the Stage? Or is it that he
wanted Discernment to see the Justness, and the Greatness,
and the Harmony of their Designs, and the
Reasonableness of those Rules upon which those Designs
are founded? Or how come his Successors to have that
Discernment which he wanted, when they fall so much
below him in other things? How comes he to have been
guilty of the grossest Faults in Chronology, and how come
we to find out those Faults? In his Tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Troylus</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cressida</span></span>, he introduces
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hector</span></span> speaking of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>,
who was born a thousand Years after the Death of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hector</span></span>. In the same Play
mention is made of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milo</span></span>, which
is another very great Fault in Chronology. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander</span></span> is
mention'd in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>, tho' that Conqueror of the Orient
liv'd about two hundred Years after him. In this last
Tragedy he has mistaken the very Names of his Dramatick
Persons, if we give Credit to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Livy</span></span>. For the Mother
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Historian is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vetturia</span></span>, and the
Wife is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volumnia</span></span>. Whereas in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> the Wife is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Virgilia</span></span>, and the Mother
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volumnia</span></span>. And the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volscian</span></span>
General in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tullus Aufidius</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tullus Attius</span></span>
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Livy</span></span>. How comes it that
he takes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plutarch</span></span>'s Word,
who was by Birth a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Græcian</span></span>,
for the Affairs of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>,
rather than that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Historian, if so be that he
had read the latter? Or what Reason can be given for
his not reading him, when he wrote upon a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Story,
but that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s time there was a Translation of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plutarch</span></span>, and there was none
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Livy</span></span>? If <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was
familiarly conversant with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Authors, how came
he to introduce a Rabble into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>, in which he
offended not only against the Dignity of Tragedy, but
the Truth of Fact, the Authority of all the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Writers,
the Customs of Ancient <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>, and the Majesty of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> People? By introducing a Rabble into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Julius
Cæsar</span></span>, he only offended against the Dignity of Tragedy.
For that part of the People who ran about the Streets
upon great Festivals, or publick Calamities, or publick
Rejoicings, or Revolutions in Government, are certainly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Scum of the Populace. But the Persons who in the
Time of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> rose in Vindication of their just Rights,
and extorted from the Patricians the Institution of the
Tribunes of the People, and the Persons by whom afterwards
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> was tried, were the whole Body of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> People to the Reserve of the Patricians, which
Body included the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Knights, and the wealthy substantial
Citizens, who were as different from the Rabble as
the Patricians themselves, as qualify'd as the latter to form
a right Judgment of Things, and to contemn the vain
Opinions of the Rabble. So at least <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horace</span></span> esteems them,
who very well knew his Countrymen.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was so conversant with the Ancients, how
comes he to have introduc'd some Characters into his
Plays so unlike what they are to be found in History?
In the Character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menenius</span></span> in the following Tragedy,
he has doubly offended against that Historical Resemblance.
For first whereas <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menenius</span></span> was an eloquent
Person, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> has made him a downright Buffoon.
And how is it possible for any Man to conceive a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ciceronian Jack-pudding</span></span>? Never was any Buffoon eloquent,
or wise, or witty, or virtuous. All the good
and ill Qualities of a Buffoon are summ'd up in one
Word, and that is a Buffoon. And secondly, whereas
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> has made him a Hater and Contemner and
Villifier of the People, we are assur'd by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span>
Historian that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menenius</span></span> was extremely popular. He was
so very far from opposing the Institution of the Tribunes,
as he is represented in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, that he was chiefly
instrumental in it. After the People had deserted the
City, and sat down upon the sacred Mountain, he was the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chief of the Delegates whom the Senate deputed to them,
as being look'd upon to be the Person who would be most
agreeable to them. In short, this very <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menenius</span></span> both
liv'd and dy'd so very much their Favourite, that dying
poor he had pompous Funerals at the Expence of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> People.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> read either
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sallust</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cicero</span></span>, how could
he have made so very little of the first and greatest of
Men, as that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> should be but a Fourth-rate Actor in
his own Tragedy? How could it have been that, seeing
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>, we should ask
for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>? That we should ask,
where is his unequall'd Greatness of Mind, his unbounded
Thirst of Glory, and that victorious Eloquence, with
which he triumph'd over the Souls of both Friends and
Enemies, and with which he rivall'd <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cicero</span></span> in Genius as
he did <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pompey</span></span> in Power? How fair an Occasion was
there to open the Character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> in the first Scene
between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cassius</span></span>? For when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cassius</span></span> tells
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span> that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> was but a Man like them, and had the
same natural Imperfections which they had, how natural
had it been for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span> to
reply, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> indeed had
their Imperfections of Nature, but neither he nor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cassius</span></span>
had by any means the great Qualities of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>: neither
his Military Virtue, nor Science, nor his matchless
Renown, nor his unparallell'd Victories, his unwearied
Bounty to his Friends, nor his Godlike Clemency to
his Foes, his Beneficence, his Munificence, his Easiness
of Access to the meanest <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span>, his indefatigable
Labours, his incredible Celerity, the Plausibleness if
not Justness of his Ambition, that knowing himself
to be the greatest of Men, he only sought occasion to
make the World confess him such. In short, if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span>,
after enumerating all the wonderful Qualities of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>,
had resolv'd in spight of them all to sacrifice him to
publick Liberty, how had such a Proceeding heighten'd
the Virtue and the Character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span>? But then
indeed it would have been requisite that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> upon his
Appearance should have made all this good. And as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we know no Principle of human Action but human Sentiment
only, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>, who did greater Things, and had
greater Designs than the rest of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span>, ought certainly
to have outshin'd by many Degrees all the other
Characters of his Tragedy. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> ought particularly
to have justified his Actions, and to have heighten'd his
Character, by shewing that what he had done, he had
done by Necessity; that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span> had lost their
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agrarian</span></span>, lost their Rotation of Magistracy, and that
consequently nothing but an empty Shadow of publick
Liberty remain'd; that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gracchi</span></span> had made the last
noble but unsuccessful Efforts for the restoring the
Commonwealth, that they had fail'd for want of arbitrary
irresistible Power, the Restoration of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agrarian</span></span> requiring
too vast a Retrospect to be done without it; that the
Government, when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> came to publick Affairs, was
got into the Hands of a few, and that those few were
factious, and were contending among themselves, and, if
you will pardon so mean an Expression, scrambling as it
were for Power; that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> was reduc'd to the Necessity
of ruling, or himself obeying a Master; and that apprehending
that another would exercise the supreme Command
without that Clemency and Moderation which he
did, he had rather chosen to rule than to obey. So that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> was faulty not so much in seizing upon the
Sovereignty, which was become in a manner necessary, as
in not re-establishing the Commonwealth, by restoring
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agrarian</span></span> and the Rotation of Magistracies, after he
had got absolute and uncontroulable Power. And if
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> had seiz'd upon the Sovereignty only with a View
of re-establishing Liberty, he had surpass'd all Mortals
in Godlike Goodness as much as he did in the rest of
his astonishing Qualities. I must confess, I do not
remember that we have any Authority from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span>
Historians which may induce us to believe that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>
had any such Design. Nor if he had had any such View,
could he, who was the most secret, the most prudent,
and the most discerning of Men, have discover'd it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parthian</span></span> Expedition was over, for fear of
utterly disobliging his Veterans. And <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> believ'd
that Expedition necessary for the Honour and Interest
of the State, and for his own Glory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But of this we may be sure, that two of the most
discerning of all the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span>, and who had the deepest
Insight into the Soul of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sallust</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cicero</span></span>, were
not without Hopes that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> would really re-establish
Liberty, or else they would not have attack'd him upon
it; the one in his Oration for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Marcus Marcellus</span></span>, the
other in the Second Part of that little Treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Republica
ordinanda</span></span>, which is address'd to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hæc
igitur tibi reliqua pars, says Cicero, Hic restat Actus, in
hoc elaborandum est, ut Rempublicam constituas, eaque tu

Cicero</span></span> therefore was not without Hope that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> would
re-establish the Commonwealth; and any one who attentively
peruses that Oration of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cicero</span></span>, will find that that
Hope was reasonably grounded upon his knowledge of
the great Qualities of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>, his Clemency, his Beneficence,
his admirable Discernment; and that avoidless
Ruine in which the whole Empire would be soon involv'd,
if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> did not effect this.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sallust</span></span> urges it still
more home to him and with greater vehemence; he
has recourse to every Motive that may be thought to
be powerful over so great a Soul. He exhorts him by
the Memory of his matchless Conquests, not to suffer
the invincible Empire of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> People to be
devour'd by Time, or to be torn in pieces by Discord;
one of which would soon and infallibly happen, if
Liberty was not restor'd.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He introduces his Country and his Progenitors urging
him in a noble Prosopopeia, by all the mighty Benefits
which they had conferr'd upon him, with so little Pains
of his own, not to deny them that just and easy Request
of the Restoration of Liberty. He adjures him by those
Furies which will eternally haunt his Soul upon his
impious Refusal: He implores him by the foresight of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those dismal Calamities, that horrible Slaughter, those
endless Wars, and that unbounded Devastation, which
will certainly fall upon Mankind, if the Restoration of
Liberty is prevented by his Death, or his incurable
Sickness: And lastly, he entreats him by his Thirst of
immortal Glory, that Glory in which he now has Rivals,
if he has not Equals; but which, if he re-establishes
Liberty, will be acknowledg'd by consenting Nations
to have neither Equal nor Second.

I am apt to believe that if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> had been
acquainted with all this, we had had from him quite
another Character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> than that which we now
find in him. He might then have given us a Scene
something like that which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Corneille</span></span> has so happily us'd
in his Cinna; something like that which really happen'd
between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Augustus</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mecænas</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agrippa</span></span>. He might
then have introduc'd <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>
consulting <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cicero</span></span> on the
one side, and on the other <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anthony</span></span>, whether he should
retain that absolute Sovereignty which he had acquir'd
by his Victory, or whether he should re-establish and
immortalize Liberty. That would have been a Scene
which might have employ'd the finest Art and the utmost
force of a Writer. That had been a Scene in which all
the great Qualities of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> might have been display'd.
I will not pretend to determine here how that Scene
might have been turn'd; and what I have already said
on this Subject, has been spoke with the utmost Caution
and Diffidence. But this I will venture to say, that if
that Scene had been manag'd so, as, by the powerful
Motives employ'd in it, to have shaken the Soul of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>, and to have left room for the least Hope, for the
least Doubt, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> would have re-establish'd Liberty,
after his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parthian</span></span> Expedition; and if this Conversation had
been kept secret till the Death of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>, and then had been
discover'd by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anthony</span></span>;
then had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span> fall'n, so belov'd
and lamented by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> People, so pitied and so
bewail'd even by the Conspirators themselves, as never
Man fell. Then there would have been a Catastrophe
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the most dreadful and the most deplorable that ever was
beheld upon the Tragick Stage. Then had we seen the
noblest of the Conspirators cursing their temerarious
Act, and the most apprehensive of them in dreadful
expectation of those horrible Calamities which fell
upon the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span> after the
Death of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>. But, Sir,
when I write this to you, I write it with the utmost
Deference to the extraordinary Judgment of that great
Man who some Years ago, I hear, alter'd the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Julius
Cæsar</span></span>. And I make no doubt but that his fine Discernment
and the rest of his great Qualities have amply
supply'd the Defects which are found in the Character of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæsar</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I come now to the main Argument, which some
People urge to prove that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was conversant
with the Ancients. For there is, say they, among
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s Plays, one call'd
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Comedy of Errors</span></span>,
which is undeniably an Imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menechmi</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span>. Now
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, say they, being conversant
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span>, it undeniably follows that he was
acquainted with the Ancients; because no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span>
Author could be hard to him who had conquer'd
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span>. To which I answer, that the Errors which
we have mention'd above are to be accounted for no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other way but by the want of knowing the Ancients,
or by downright want of Capacity. But nothing can
be more absurd or more unjust than to impute it to
want of Capacity. For the very Sentiments of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
alone are sufficient to shew that he had a great
Understanding: And therefore we must account some
other way for his Imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menechmi</span></span>. I remember
to have seen, among the Translations of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ovid</span></span>'s
Epistles printed by Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tonson</span></span>, an Imitation of that
from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Œnone</span></span> to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paris</span></span>, which Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dryden</span></span> tells us in
his Preface to those Epistles was imitated by one of
the Fair Sex who understood no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span>, but that she
had done enough to make those blush who understood
it the best. There are at this day several Translators,
who, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hudibrass</span></span> has it,

I will not affirm that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>; I believe he was
able to do what Pedants call construe, but that he
was able to read <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span> without Pain and Difficulty
I can never believe. Now I appeal to you, Sir, what
time he had between his Writing and his Acting, to
read any thing that could not be read with Ease and
Pleasure. We see that our Adversaries themselves
acknowledge, that if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
was able to read <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span>
with Ease, nothing in Latinity could be hard to him.
How comes it to pass then, that he has given us no
Proofs of his familiar Acquaintance with the Ancients,
but this Imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menechmi</span></span>, and a Version of
two Epistles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ovid</span></span>? How comes it that he had
never read <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horace</span></span>, of a superiour Merit to either, and
particularly his Epistle to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Piso's</span></span>, which so much
concern'd his Art? Or if he had read that Epistle,
how comes it that in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Troylus</span></span>

Tho' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> succeeded very well in Comedy, yet
his principal Talent and his chief Delight was Tragedy.
If then <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was
qualify'd to read <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span> with
Ease, he could read with a great deal more Ease the
Translations of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sophocles</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euripides</span></span>. And tho' by
these Translations he would not have been able to
have seen the charming colouring of those great
Masters, yet would he have seen all the Harmony
and the Beauty of their great and their just Designs.
He would have seen enough to have stirr'd up a
noble Emulation in so exalted a Soul as his. How
comes it then that we hear nothing from him of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Œdipus</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Electra</span></span>,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antigone</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sophocles</span></span>, of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenia</span></span>'s, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orestes</span></span>,

of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euripides</span></span>?
How comes it that we see nothing in the
Conduct of his Pieces, that shews us that he had the
least Acquaintance with any of these great Masterpieces?
Did <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> appear to be so nearly touch'd
with the Affliction of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecuba</span></span>
for the Death of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Priam</span></span>,
which was but daub'd and bungled by one of his
Countrymen, that he could not forbear introducing it
as it were by Violence into his own <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>, and would
he make no Imitation, no Commendation, not the
least Mention of the unparallell'd and inimitable Grief
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecuba</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euripides</span></span>?
How comes it that we
find no Imitation of any ancient Play in Him but the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menechmi</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span>?
How came he to chuse a Comick
preferably to the Tragick Poets? Or how comes he
to chuse <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span> preferably to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Terence</span></span>, who is so much
more just, more graceful, more regular, and more
natural? Or how comes he to chuse the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menechmi</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span>, which is by no means his Master-piece,
before all his other Comedies? I vehemently suspect
that this Imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menechmi</span></span> was either from
a printed Translation of that Comedy which is lost, or
some Version in Manuscript brought him by a Friend,
or sent him perhaps by a Stranger, or from the
original Play it self recommended to him, and read to
him by some learned Friend. In short, I had rather
account for this by what is not absurd than by what
is, or by a less Absurdity than by a greater. For
nothing can be more wrong than to conclude from
this that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was conversant with the Ancients;
which contradicts the Testimony of his Contemporary
and his familiar Acquaintance <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span>, and of his
Successor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milton</span></span>;

destroys the most glorious Part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s Merit
immediately. For how can he be esteem'd equal by
Nature or superior to the Ancients, when he falls so
far short of them in Art, tho' he had the Advantage
of knowing all that they did before him? Nay it
debases him below those of common Capacity, by
reason of the Errors which we mention'd above.
Therefore he who allows that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> had Learning
and a familiar Acquaintance with the Ancients, ought
to be look'd upon as a Detractor from his extraordinary
Merit, and from the Glory of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great Britain</span></span>.
For whether is it more honourable for this Island to
have produc'd a Man who, without having any Acquaintance
with the Ancients, or any but a slender
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a superficial one, appears to be their Equal or
their Superiour by the Force of Genius and Nature,
or to have bred one who, knowing the Ancients, falls
infinitely short of them in Art, and consequently in
Nature it self? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great Britain</span></span> has but little Reason to
boast of its Natives Education, since the same that
they had here, they might have had in another place.
But it may justly claim a very great share in their
Nature and Genius, since these depend in a great
measure on the Climate; and therefore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horace</span></span>, in the
Instruction which he gives for the forming the Characters,
advises the noble <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span> for whose Instruction he
chiefly writes to consider whether the Dramatick Person
whom they introduce is

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, Sir, I have endeavour'd to shew under what
great Disadvantages <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> lay, for want of the
Poetical Art, and for want of being conversant with
the Ancients.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But besides this, he lay under other very great
Inconveniencies. For he was neither Master of Time
enough to consider, correct, and polish what he wrote,
to alter it, to add to it, and to retrench from it, nor
had he Friends to consult upon whose Capacity and
Integrity he could depend. And tho' a Person of
very good Judgment may succeed very well without
consulting his Friends, if he takes time enough to
correct what he writes; yet even the greatest Man
that Nature and Art can conspire to accomplish, can
never attain to Perfection, without either employing a
great deal of time, or taking the Advice of judicious
Friends. Nay, 'tis the Opinion of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horace</span></span> that he
ought to do both.

Now we know very well that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was an Actor,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at a time when there were seven or eight Companies
of Players in the Town together, who each of them
did their utmost Endeavours to get the Audiences
from the rest, and consequently that our Author was
perpetually call'd upon, by those who had the Direction
and Management of the Company to which he
belong'd, for new Pieces which might be able to
support them, and give them some Advantage over
the rest. And 'tis easie to judge what Time he was
Master of, between his laborious Employment of Acting
and his continual Hurry of Writing. As for Friends,
they whom in all likelihood <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> consulted most
were two or three of his Fellow-Actors, because they
had the Care of publishing his Works committed to
them. Now they, as we are told by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span> in

These Friends then of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> were not qualify'd

not the most communicative Person in the World of

no right Notion of Tragedy. Nay, so far from it,
that he who was indeed a very great Man, and who
has writ Comedies, by which he has born away the
Prize of Comedy both from Ancients and Moderns,
and been an Honour to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great Britain</span></span>; and who has

done this without any Rules to guide him, except
what his own incomparable Talent dictated to him;
This extraordinary Man has err'd so grossly in
Tragedy, of which there were not only stated Rules,
but Rules which he himself had often read, and had
even translated, that he has chosen two Subjects,
which, according to those very Rules, were utterly
incapable of exciting either Compassion or Terror for
the principal Characters, which yet are the chief Passions
that a Tragick Poet ought to endeavour to excite. So
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> having neither had Time to correct,

left such faults in his Writings, for the Correction
of which either a great deal of Time or a judicious
and a well-natur'd Friend is indispensably necessary.

There is more than one Example of every kind of
these Faults in the Tragedies of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, and even
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>. There are Lines that are utterly
void of that celestial Fire of which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> is
sometimes Master in so great a Degree. And consequently
there are Lines that are stiff and forc'd,
and harsh and unmusical, tho' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> had naturally
an admirable Ear for the Numbers. But no Man
ever was very musical who did not write with Fire,
and no Man can always write with Fire, unless he is
so far Master of his Time, as to expect those Hours
when his Spirits are warm and volatile. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
must therefore sometimes have Lines which are neither
strong nor graceful: For who ever had Force or
Grace that had not Spirit? There are in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>,
among a great many natural and admirable
Beauties, three or four of those Ornaments which
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horace</span></span> would term ambitious;

I have, Sir, employ'd some Time and Pains, and

Rabble into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>, I have not only retain'd in

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Customs than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>

Account of the Beauties and Defects of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>,
with an Intention to make these Letters publick

distinguish between his Beauties and his Defects, that
while they imitate the one, they may with Caution
avoid the other [there being nothing of more dangerous
Contagion to Writers, and especially to young ones,

Reproach of those who would fix a Brand even upon

may accuse me of the want of a due Veneration for
the Merit of an Author of so establish'd a Reputation
as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, I shall beg leave to tell them, that they
chuse the wrongest time that they could possibly take
for such an Accusation as that. For I appeal to you,
Sir, who shews most Veneration for the Memory of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, he who loves and admires his Charms and
makes them one of his chief Delights, who sees him
and reads him over and over and still remains unsatiated,
and who mentions his Faults for no other
Reason but to make his Excellency the more conspicuous,
or he who, pretending to be his blind Admirer,
shews in Effect the utmost Contempt for him, preferring
empty effeminate Sound to his solid Beauties
and manly Graces, and deserting him every Night for
an execrable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Italian</span></span> Ballad, so vile that a Boy who
should write such lamentable Dogrel would be turn'd

It is not my design to enter into a Criticism upon this
Author; tho' to do it effectually and not superficially
would be the best occasion that any just Writer could
take, to form the judgment and taste of our nation. For
of all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Poets
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> must be confessed to be
the fairest and fullest subject for Criticism, and to afford
the most numerous as well as most conspicuous instances,
both of Beauties and Faults of all sorts. But this far
exceeds the bounds of a Preface, the business of which is
only to give an account of the fate of his Works, and the
disadvantages under which they have been transmitted to
us. We shall hereby extenuate many faults which are
his, and clear him from the imputation of many which are
not: A design, which, tho' it can be no guide to future
Criticks to do him justice in one way, will at least be
sufficient to prevent their doing him an injustice in the
other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot however but mention some of his principal
and characteristic Excellencies, for which (notwithstanding
his defects) he is justly and universally elevated above
all other Dramatic Writers. Not that this is the proper
place of praising him, but because I would not omit any
occasion of doing it.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If ever any Author deserved the name of an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Original</span></span>,
it was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homer</span></span> himself drew not his art so
immediately from the fountains of Nature; it proceeded
thro' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ægyptian</span></span> strainers and channels, and came to him
not without some tincture of the learning, or some cast of
the models, of those before him. The Poetry of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
was Inspiration indeed: he is not so much an
Imitator, as an Instrument, of Nature; and 'tis not so
just to say that he speaks from her, as that she speaks
thro' him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Characters</span></span> are so much Nature her self, that 'tis
a sort of injury to call them by so distant a name as
Copies of her. Those of other Poets have a constant
resemblance, which shews that they receiv'd them from
one another, and were but multiplyers of the same image:
each picture, like a mock-rainbow, is but the reflexion of
a reflexion. But every single character in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> is
as much an Individual as those in Life itself; it is as
impossible to find any two alike; and such as from their
relation or affinity in any respect appear most to be Twins,
will upon comparison be found remarkably distinct. To
this life and variety of Character, we must add the wonderful
Preservation of it; which is such throughout his
plays, that had all the Speeches been printed without the
very names of the Persons, I believe one might have
apply'd them with certainty to every speaker.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Power</span></span> over our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Passions</span></span> was never possess'd in a
more eminent degree, or display'd in so different instances.
Yet all along, there is seen no labour, no pains to raise
them; no preparation to guide our guess to the effect,
or be perceiv'd to lead toward it: But the heart swells,
and the tears burst out, just at the proper places: We are
surpriz'd, the moment we weep; and yet upon reflection
find the passion so just, that we shou'd be surpriz'd if we
had not wept, and wept at that very moment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How astonishing is it again, that the passions directly
opposite to these, Laughter and Spleen, are no less at his
command! that he is not more a master of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great</span></span>, than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ridiculous</span></span> in human nature; of our noblest tendernesses,
than of our vainest foibles; of our strongest
emotions, than of our idlest sensations!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor does he only excel in the Passions: In the coolness
of Reflection and Reasoning he is full as admirable. His
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sentiments</span></span> are not only in general the most pertinent and
judicious upon every subject; but by a talent very
peculiar, something between Penetration and Felicity, he
hits upon that particular point on which the bent of each
argument turns, or the force of each motive depends.
This is perfectly amazing, from a man of no education
or experience in those great and publick scenes of life
which are usually the subject of his thoughts: So that he
seems to have known the world by Intuition, to have
look'd thro' humane nature at one glance, and to be the
only Author that gives ground for a very new opinion,
That the Philosopher, and even the Man of the world,
may be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Born</span></span>, as well as the Poet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be own'd that with all these great excellencies
he has almost as great defects; and that as he has certainly
written better, so he has perhaps written worse,
than any other. But I think I can in some measure
account for these defects, from several causes and
accidents; without which it is hard to imagine that so
large and so enlighten'd a mind could ever have been
susceptible of them. That all these Contingencies should
unite to his disadvantage seems to me almost as singularly
unlucky, as that so many various (nay contrary) Talents
should meet in one man, was happy and extraordinary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be allowed that Stage-Poetry of all other is
more particularly levell'd to please the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Populace</span></span>, and its
success more immediately depending upon the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Common
Suffrage</span></span>. One cannot therefore wonder, if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>,
having at his first appearance no other aim in his writings
than to procure a subsistance, directed his endeavours
solely to hit the taste and humour that then prevailed.
The Audience was generally composed of the meaner sort
of people; and therefore the Images of Life were to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
drawn from those of their own rank: accordingly we
find that not our Author's only but almost all the
old Comedies have their Scene among <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tradesmen</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mechanicks</span></span>: And even their Historical Plays strictly follow
the common <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Stories</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vulgar Traditions</span></span> of that kind
of people. In Tragedy, nothing was so sure to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Surprize</span></span>
and cause <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Admiration</span></span>, as the most strange, unexpected,
and consequently most unnatural, Events and Incidents;
the most exaggerated Thoughts; the most verbose and
bombast Expression; the most pompous Rhymes, and
thundering Versification. In Comedy, nothing was so
sure to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">please</span></span>, as mean buffoonry, vile ribaldry, and unmannerly
jests of fools and clowns. Yet even in these
our Author's Wit buoys up, and is born above his subject:
his Genius in those low parts is like some Prince of a
Romance in the disguise of a Shepherd or Peasant; a
certain Greatness and Spirit now and then break out,
which manifest his higher extraction and qualities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be added, that not only the common Audience
had no notion of the rules of writing, but few even of the
better sort piqu'd themselves upon any great degree of
knowledge or nicety that way, till <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span> getting
possession of the Stage brought critical learning into
vogue: And that this was not done without difficulty,
may appear from those frequent lessons (and indeed almost
Declamations) which he was forced to prefix to his first
plays, and put into the mouth of his Actors, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grex</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chorus</span></span>, &amp;c. to remove the prejudices, and inform the
judgment of his hearers. Till then, our Authors had no
thoughts of writing on the model of the Ancients: their
Tragedies were only Histories in Dialogue; and their
Comedies follow'd the thread of any Novel as they found
it, no less implicitly than if it had been true History.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To judge therefore of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>'s rules, is
like trying a man by the Laws of one Country, who acted
under those of another. He writ to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">People</span></span>; and writ
at first without patronage from the better sort, and therefore
without aims of pleasing them: without assistance or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
advice from the Learned, as without the advantage of
education or acquaintance among them: without that
knowledge of the best models, the Ancients, to inspire
him with an emulation of them; in a word, without any
views of Reputation, and of what Poets are pleas'd to call
Immortality: Some or all of which have encourag'd the
vanity, or animated the ambition, of other writers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet it must be observ'd, that when his performances
had merited the protection of his Prince, and when the
encouragement of the Court had succeeded to that of the
Town, the works of his riper years are manifestly raised
above those of his former. The Dates of his plays
sufficiently evidence that his productions improved, in
proportion to the respect he had for his auditors. And
I make no doubt this observation will be found true in
every instance, were but Editions extant from which we
might learn the exact time when every piece was composed,
and whether writ for the Town or the Court.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another Cause (and no less strong than the former)
may be deduced from our Author's being a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Player</span></span>, and
forming himself first upon the judgments of that body of
men whereof he was a member. They have ever had a
Standard to themselves, upon other principles than those
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>. As they live by the Majority, they know no
rule but that of pleasing the present humour, and complying
with the wit in fashion; a consideration which brings
all their judgment to a short point. Players are just such
judges of what is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></span>,
as Taylors are of what is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">graceful</span></span>.
And in this view it will be but fair to allow, that most of
our Author's faults are less to be ascribed to his wrong
judgment as a Poet, than to his right judgment as a
Player.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By these men it was thought a praise to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>,
that he scarce ever <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">blotted a line</span></span>. This they industriously
propagated, as appears from what we are told by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben
Johnson</span></span> in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Discoveries</span></span>, and from the preface of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heminges</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Condell</span></span>
to the first folio Edition. But in
reality (however it has prevailed) there never was a more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
groundless report, or to the contrary of which there are
more undeniable evidences: As, the Comedy of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Merry Wives</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Windsor</span></span>, which he entirely new writ;
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History of</span></span> Henry
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the 6th</span></span>, which was first published
under the Title of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Contention of</span></span>
York <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> Lancaster;
and that of Henry <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the 5th</span></span>, extreamly improved; that of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> enlarged to almost as much again as at first, and
many others. I believe the common opinion of his want
of Learning proceeded from no better ground. This too
might be thought a Praise by some; and to this his
Errors have as injudiciously been ascribed by others.
For 'tis certain, were it true, it would concern but a
small part of them; the most are such as are not properly
Defects, but Superfœtations: and arise not from want of
learning or reading, but from want of thinking or judging:
or rather (to be more just to our Author) from a
compliance to those wants in others. As to a wrong
choice of the subject, a wrong conduct of the incidents,
false thoughts, forc'd expressions, &amp;c. if these are not to
be ascrib'd to the foresaid accidental reasons, they must
be charg'd upon the Poet himself, and there is no help
for it. But I think the two Disadvantages which I have
mentioned (to be obliged to please the lowest of the
people, and to keep the worst of company), if the consideration
be extended as far as it reasonably may, will
appear sufficient to mis-lead and depress the greatest
Genius upon earth. Nay the more modesty with which
such a one is endued, the more he is in danger of submitting
and conforming to others, against his own better
judgment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But as to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Want of Learning</span></span>, it may be necessary to
say something more: There is certainly a vast difference
between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Learning</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Languages</span></span>. How far he was
ignorant of the latter, I cannot determine; but 'tis plain
he had much Reading at least, if they will not call it
Learning. Nor is it any great matter, if a man has
Knowledge, whether he has it from one language or from
another. Nothing is more evident than that he had a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
taste of natural Philosophy, Mechanicks, ancient and
modern History, Poetical learning, and Mythology: We
find him very knowing in the customs, rites, and manners
of Antiquity. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Julius Cæsar</span></span>, not only
the Spirit, but Manners, of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span> are exactly drawn;
and still a nicer distinction is shewn, between the manners
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></span> in the time of the former and of the latter.
His reading in the ancient Historians is no less conspicuous,
in many references to particular passages: and the
speeches copy'd from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plutarch</span></span>
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span> may, I think,
as well be made an instance of his learning, as those copy'd
from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cicero</span></span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catiline</span></span>,
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span>'s. The manners of
other nations in general, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Egyptians</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Venetians</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French</span></span>,
&amp;c., are drawn with equal propriety. Whatever object
of nature, or branch of science, he either speaks of or
describes, it is always with competent, if not extensive
knowledge: his descriptions are still exact; all his metaphors
appropriated, and remarkably drawn from the true
nature and inherent qualities of each subject. When he
treats of Ethic or Politic, we may constantly observe a
wonderful justness of distinction, as well as extent of
comprehension. No one is more a master of the Poetical
story, or has more frequent allusions to the various parts
of it: Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Waller</span></span> (who has been celebrated for this last
particular) has not shown more learning this way than
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>. We have Translations
from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ovid</span></span> published
in his name, among those Poems which pass for his, and
for some of which we have undoubted authority (being
published by himself, and dedicated to his noble Patron
the Earl of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Southampton</span></span>). He appears also to have been
conversant in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus</span></span>, from whom he has taken the plot
of one of his plays: he follows the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></span> Authors, and
particularly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dares Phrygius</span></span>, in another (altho' I will not
pretend to say in what language he read them). The
modern <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Italian</span></span> writers of Novels he was manifestly
acquainted with; and we may conclude him to be no
less conversant with the Ancients of his own country,
from the use he has made of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chaucer</span></span>
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Troilus</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cressida</span></span>, and in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Two Noble Kinsmen</span></span>, if that Play be
his, as there goes a Tradition it was (and indeed it has
little resemblance of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fletcher</span></span>, and more of our Author
than some of those which have been received as genuine).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am inclined to think, this opinion proceeded originally
from the zeal of the Partizans of our Author and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben
Johnson</span></span>; as they endeavoured to exalt the one at the
expence of the other. It is ever the nature of Parties to
be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that
because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span> had much the more learning, it was
said on the one hand that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> had none at all; and
because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> had much the most wit and fancy, it
was retorted on the other, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Johnson</span></span> wanted both.
Because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> borrowed
nothing, it was said that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben
Johnson</span></span> borrowed every thing. Because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Johnson</span></span> did not
write extempore, he was reproached with being a year
about every piece; and because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> wrote with ease
and rapidity, they cryed, he never once made a blot. Nay
the spirit of opposition ran so high, that whatever those of
the one side objected to the other, was taken at the
rebound, and turned into Praises; as injudiciously as
their antagonists before had made them Objections.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poets are always afraid of Envy; but sure they have as
much reason to be afraid of Admiration. They are the

often fall by the other. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pessimum genus inimicorum

But however this contention might be carried on by the
Partizans on either side, I cannot help thinking these two
great Poets were good friends, and lived on amicable
terms and in offices of society with each other. It is an
acknowledged fact, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span> was introduced upon
the Stage, and his first works encouraged, by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>.
And after his death, that Author writes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">To the memory of
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
his beloved Mr.</span></span> William Shakespear, which shows as if the
friendship had continued thro' life. I cannot for my own
part find any thing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Invidious</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sparing</span></span> in those verses, but
wonder Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dryden</span></span> was of that opinion. He exalts him
not only above all his Contemporaries, but above <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chaucer</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spenser</span></span>, whom he will not allow to be great enough to
be rank'd with him; and challenges the names of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sophocles</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euripides</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Æschylus</span></span>,
nay all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greece</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span> at once,
to equal him: And (which is very particular) expressly
vindicates him from the imputation of wanting <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art</span></span>, not
enduring that all his excellencies shou'd be attributed to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nature</span></span>. It is remarkable too, that the praise he gives him
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Discoveries</span></span> seems to
proceed from a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">personal kindness</span></span>;
he tells us that he lov'd the man, as well as honoured his
memory; celebrates the honesty, openness, and frankness
of his temper; and only distinguishes, as he reasonably
ought, between the real merit of the Author, and the silly
and derogatory applauses of the Players. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span>
might indeed be sparing in his Commendations (tho'
certainly he is not so in this instance) partly from his own
nature, and partly from judgment. For men of judgment
think they do any man more service in praising him justly,
than lavishly. I say, I would fain believe they were
Friends, tho' the violence and ill-breeding of their Followers
and Flatterers were enough to give rise to the contrary
report. I would hope that it may be with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parties</span></span>, both
in Wit and State, as with those Monsters described by the
Poets; and that their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heads</span></span> at least may have something
humane, tho' their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bodies</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tails</span></span> are wild beasts and
serpents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As I believe that what I have mentioned gave rise to the
opinion of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s want of learning; so what has
continued it down to us may have been the many blunders
and illiteracies of the first Publishers of his works. In
these Editions their ignorance shines almost in every page;
nothing is more common than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Actus tertia</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exit Omnes</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enter three Witches solus</span></span>. Their French is as bad as their
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span>, both in construction and spelling: Their very
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Welsh</span></span> is false. Nothing is more likely than that those
palpable blunders of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hector</span></span>'s
quoting <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>, with others
of that gross kind, sprung from the same root: It not
being at all credible that these could be the errors of any
man who had the least tincture of a School, or the least
conversation with such as had. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span> (whom they
will not think partial to him) allows him at least to have
had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">some Latin</span></span>; which is utterly inconsistent with mistakes
like these. Nay the constant blunders in proper names of
persons and places, are such as must have proceeded from
a man who had not so much as read any history, in any
language: so could not be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall now lay before the reader some of those almost
innumerable Errors which have risen from one source, the
ignorance of the Players, both as his actors, and as his
editors. When the nature and kinds of these are enumerated
and considered, I dare to say that not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
only, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cicero</span></span>, had their works undergone
the same fate, might have appear'd to want sense as well
as learning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not certain that any one of his Plays was published
by himself. During the time of his employment in the
Theatre, several of his pieces were printed separately in
Quarto. What makes me think that most of these were
not publish'd by him, is the excessive carelessness of the
press: every page is so scandalously false spelled, and
almost all the learned and unusual words so intolerably
mangled, that it's plain there either was no Correcter to the
press at all, or one totally illiterate. If any were supervised
by himself, I should fancy the two parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry the
4th</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midsummer-Night's Dream</span></span> might have been so:
because I find no other printed with any exactness; and
(contrary to the rest) there is very little variation in
all the subsequent editions of them. There are extant two
Prefaces, to the first quarto edition of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Troilus</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cressida</span></span>
in 1609, and to that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Othello</span></span>; by which it appears, that
the first was publish'd without his knowledge or consent,
and even before it was acted, so late as seven or eight years
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before he died: and that the latter was not printed till
after his death. The whole number of genuine plays
which we have been able to find printed in his life-time,
amounts but to eleven. And of some of these, we meet
with two or more editions by different printers, each of
which has whole heaps of trash different from the other:
which I should fancy was occasion'd by their being taken
from different copies, belonging to different Playhouses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The folio edition (in which all the plays we now receive
as his were first collected) was published by two Players,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heming</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Condell</span></span>,
in 1623, seven years after his decease.
They declare that all the other editions were stolen and
surreptitious, and affirm theirs to be purged from the
errors of the former. This is true as to the literal errors,
and no other; for in all respects else it is far worse than
the Quarto's:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, because the additions of trifling and bombast
passages are in this edition far more numerous. For
whatever had been added, since those Quarto's, by the
actors, or had stolen from their mouths into the written
parts, were from thence conveyed into the printed text, and
all stand charged upon the Author. He himself complained
of this usage in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>,
where he wishes that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">those
who play the Clowns wou'd speak no more than is set down for
them</span></span> (Act 3. Sc. 4.). But as a proof that he could not
escape it, in the old editions of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romeo</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Juliet</span></span> there is no
hint of a great number of the mean conceits and ribaldries
now to be found there. In others, the low scenes of
Mobs, Plebeians, and Clowns, are vastly shorter than at
present: And I have seen one in particular (which seems
to have belonged to the Playhouse, by having the parts
divided with lines, and the Actors names in the margin)
where several of those very passages were added in a
written hand, which are since to be found in the folio.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the next place, a number of beautiful passages which
are extant in the first single editions, are omitted in this:
as it seems, without any other reason than their willingness
to shorten some scenes: These men (as it was said of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Procrustes</span></span>) either lopping or stretching an Author, to make
him just fit for their Stage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This edition is said to be printed from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Original
Copies</span></span>; I believe they meant those which had lain ever
since the Author's days in the playhouse, and had from
time to time been cut, or added to, arbitrarily. It appears
that this edition, as well as the Quarto's, was printed (at
least partly) from no better copies than the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prompter's Book</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Piece-meal Parts</span></span> written out for the use of the actors:
For in some places their very<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> names are thro' carelessness
set down instead of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Personæ Dramatis</span></span>: And in others
the notes of direction to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Property-men</span></span>
for their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moveables</span></span>,
and to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Players</span></span> for their
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Entries</span></span>,<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> are inserted into
the Text, thro' the ignorance of the Transcribers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Plays not having been before so much as distinguish'd
by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scenes</span></span>, they are in this edition
divided according as they play'd them; often when there
is no pause in the action, or where they thought fit to make
a breach in it, for the sake of Musick, Masques, or
Monsters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sometimes the scenes are transposed and shuffled backward
and forward; a thing which could no otherwise
happen, but by their being taken from separate and piece-meal-written
parts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many verses are omitted intirely, and others transposed;
from whence invincible obscurities have arisen, past
the guess of any Commentator to clear up, but just where
the accidental glympse of an old edition enlightens us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some Characters were confounded and mix'd, or two
put into one, for want of a competent number of actors.
Thus in the Quarto edition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midsummer-Night's Dream</span></span>,
Act 5, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> introduces a kind of Master of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Revels called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philostratus</span></span>: all whose part is given to
another character (that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ægeus</span></span>) in the subsequent
editions: So also in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King Lear</span></span>. This too
makes it probable that the Prompter's Books were what
they call'd the Original Copies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From liberties of this kind, many speeches also were put
into the mouths of wrong persons, where the Author now
seems chargeable with making them speak out of character:
Or sometimes perhaps for no better reason than that a
governing Player, to have the mouthing of some favourite
speech himself, would snatch it from the unworthy lips of
an Underling.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Prose from verse they did not know, and they accordingly
printed one for the other throughout the volume.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having been forced to say so much of the Players, I
think I ought in justice to remark, that the Judgment, as
well as Condition, of that class of people was then far
inferior to what it is in our days. As then the best Playhouses
were Inns and Taverns (the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Globe</span></span>,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hope</span></span>, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Red Bull</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fortune</span></span>,
&amp;c.), so the top of the profession
were then meer Players, not Gentlemen of the stage:
They were led into the Buttery by the Steward, not plac'd
at the Lord's table, or Lady's toilette: and consequently
were intirely depriv'd of those advantages they now enjoy,
in the familiar conversation of our Nobility, and an
intimacy (not to say dearness) with people of the first
condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From what has been said, there can be no question but
had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> published his works himself (especially in
his latter time, and after his retreat from the stage) we
should not only be certain which are genuine; but should
find in those that are, the errors lessened by some
thousands. If I may judge from all the distinguishing
marks of his style, and his manner of thinking and writing,
I make no doubt to declare that those wretched plays,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pericles</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Locrine</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir John Oldcastle</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yorkshire Tragedy</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lord Cromwell</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Puritan</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London Prodigal</span></span>, cannot be
admitted as his. And I should conjecture of some of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
others (particularly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Winter's
Tale</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Titus Andronicus</span></span>), that only some characters,
single scenes, or perhaps a few particular passages,
were of his hand. It is very probable what occasion'd
some Plays to be supposed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s was only this;
that they were pieces produced by unknown authors, or
fitted up for the Theatre while it was under his administration:
and no owner claiming them, they were adjudged to
him, as they give Strays to the Lord of the Manor: A
mistake which (one may also observe) it was not for the
interest of the House to remove. Yet the Players themselves,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hemings</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Condell</span></span>,
afterwards did <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> the
justice to reject those eight plays in their edition; tho'
they were then printed in his name, in every body's hands,
and acted with some applause (as we learn from what
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Johnson</span></span> says of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pericles</span></span> in his Ode on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Inn</span></span>).
That <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Titus Andronicus</span></span> is one of this class I am the rather
induced to believe, by finding the same Author openly
express his contempt of it in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Induction</span></span>
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bartholomew-Fair</span></span>,
in the year 1614, when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was yet living.
And there is no better authority for these latter sort, than
for the former, which were equally published in his lifetime.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we give into this opinion, how many low and vicious
parts and passages might no longer reflect upon this great
Genius, but appear unworthily charged upon him? And
even in those which are really his, how many faults may
have been unjustly laid to his account from arbitrary
Additions, Expunctions, Transpositions of scenes and
lines, confusion of Characters and Persons, wrong application
of Speeches, corruptions of innumerable Passages by
the Ignorance, and wrong Corrections of 'em again by
the Impertinence, of his first Editors? From one or
other of these considerations, I am verily perswaded, that
the greatest and the grossest part of what are thought his
errors would vanish, and leave his character in a light very
different from that disadvantageous one, in which it now
appears to us.

This is the state in which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s, writings lye at
present; for since the above-mentioned Folio Edition, all
the rest have implicitly followed it, without having
recourse to any of the former, or ever making the comparison
between them. It is impossible to repair the
Injuries already done him; too much time has elaps'd,
and the materials are too few. In what I have done I
have rather given a proof of my willingness and desire,
than of my ability, to do him justice. I have discharg'd
the dull duty of an Editor to my best judgment, with more
labour than I expect thanks, with a religious abhorrence of
all Innovation, and without any indulgence to my private
sense or conjecture. The method taken in this Edition
will show it self. The various Readings are fairly put in the
margin, so that every one may compare 'em; and those I
have prefer'd into the Text are constantly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex fide Codicum</span></span>,
upon authority. The Alterations or Additions which
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> himself made, are taken notice of as they occur.
Some suspected passages which are excessively bad (and
which seem Interpolations by being so inserted that one
can intirely omit them without any chasm or deficience in
the context) are degraded to the bottom of the page; with
an Asterisk referring to the places of their insertion. The
Scenes are mark'd so distinctly that every removal of place
is specify'd; which is more necessary in this Author than
any other, since he shifts them more frequently: and
sometimes, without attending to this particular, the reader
would have met with obscurities. The more obsolete or
unusual words are explained. Some of the most shining
passages are distinguish'd by comma's in the margin; and
where the beauty lay not in particulars but in the whole, a
star is prefix'd to the scene. This seems to me a shorter
and less ostentatious method of performing the better half
of Criticism (namely the pointing out an Author's excellencies)
than to fill a whole paper with citations of fine
passages, with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">general Applauses</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">empty Exclamations</span></span> at
the tail of them. There is also subjoin'd a Catalogue of
those first Editions by which the greater part of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
various readings and of the corrected passages are
authorised (most of which are such as carry their own
evidence along with them). These Editions now hold the
place of Originals, and are the only materials left to repair
the deficiences or restore the corrupted sense of the
Author: I can only wish that a greater number of them
(if a greater were ever published) may yet be found, by a
search more successful than mine, for the better accomplishment
of this end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will conclude by saying of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, that with all his
faults, and with all the irregularity of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Drama</span></span>, one may
look upon his works, in comparison of those that are more
finish'd and regular, as upon an ancient majestick piece of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gothick</span></span> Architecture, compar'd with a neat Modern building:
The latter is more elegant and glaring, but the former
is more strong and more solemn. It must be allow'd that
in one of these there are materials enough to make many
of the other. It has much the greater variety, and much
the nobler apartments; tho' we are often conducted to
them by dark, odd, and uncouth passages. Nor does the
Whole fail to strike us with greater reverence, tho' many
of the Parts are childish, ill-plac'd, and unequal to its
grandeur.

The Attempt to write upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Shakespeare</span></span> is like going
into a large, a spacious, and a splendid Dome thro' the
Conveyance of a narrow and obscure Entry. A Glare of
Light suddenly breaks upon you beyond what the Avenue
at first promis'd: and a thousand Beauties of Genius and
Character, like so many gaudy Apartments pouring at once
upon the Eye, diffuse and throw themselves out to the
Mind. The Prospect is too wide to come within the
Compass of a single View: 'tis a gay Confusion of pleasing
Objects, too various to be enjoyed but in a general
Admiration; and they must be separated, and ey'd distinctly,
in order to give the proper Entertainment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as in great Piles of Building, some Parts are often
finish'd up to hit the Taste of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Connoisseur</span></span>; others
more negligently put together, to strike the Fancy of a
common and unlearned Beholder: Some Parts are made
stupendously magnificent and grand, to surprize with the
vast Design and Execution of the Architect; others are
contracted, to amuse you with his Neatness and Elegance
in little. So, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>,
we may find <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Traits</span></span> that will
stand the Test of the severest Judgment; and Strokes as

Capacities: Some Descriptions rais'd to that Pitch of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Grandeur, as to astonish you with the Compass and
Elevation of his Thought; and others copying Nature
within so narrow, so confined a Circle, as if the Author's
Talent lay only at drawing in Miniature.

In how many points of Light must we be obliged to
gaze at this great Poet! In how many Branches of
Excellence to consider and admire him! Whether we
view him on the Side of Art or Nature, he ought equally
to engage our Attention: Whether we respect the Force
and Greatness of his Genius, the Extent of his Knowledge
and Reading, the Power and Address with which he throws
out and applies either Nature or Learning, there is ample
scope both for our Wonder and Pleasure. If his Diction
and the cloathing of his Thoughts attract us, how much
more must we be charm'd with the Richness and Variety
of his Images and Ideas! If his Images and Ideas steal
into our Souls, and strike upon our Fancy, how much are
they improv'd in Price, when we come to reflect with what
Propriety and Justness they are apply'd to Character! If
we look into his Characters, and how they are furnish'd
and proportion'd to the Employment he cuts out for them,
how are we taken up with the Mastery of his Portraits!
What Draughts of Nature! What Variety of Originals,
and how differing each from the other! How are they
dress'd from the Stores of his own luxurious Imagination;
without being the Apes of Mode, or borrowing from any
foreign Wardrobe! Each of them are the standards of
Fashion for themselves: like Gentlemen that are above the
Direction of their Tailors, and can adorn themselves without
the aid of Imitation. If other Poets draw more than
one Fool or Coxcomb, there is the same Resemblance in
them as in that Painter's Draughts, who was happy only
at forming a Rose: you find them all younger Brothers of
the same Family, and all of them have a Pretence to
give the same Crest: But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s Clowns and Fops
come all of a different House; they are no farther
allied to one another than as Man to Man, Members
of the same Species: but as different in Features and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lineaments of Character, as we are from one another
in Face or Complexion. But I am unawares lanching
into his Character as a Writer, before I have said
what I intended of him as a private Member of the
Republick.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rowe</span></span> has very justly observ'd, that People are
fond of discovering any little personal Story of the
Great Men of Antiquity; and that the common
Accidents of their Lives naturally become the Subject
of our critical Enquiries: That however trifling such
a Curiosity at the first View may appear, yet, as for
what relates to Men of Letters, the Knowledge of an
Author may, perhaps, sometimes conduce to the better
understanding his Works: And, indeed, this Author's
Works, from the bad Treatment he has met with
from Copyists and Editors, have so long wanted a
Comment, that one would zealously embrace every
Method of Information that could contribute to recover
them from the injuries with which they have so long
lain o'erwhelm'd.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
'Tis certain that if we have first admir'd the Man
in his Writings, his Case is so circumstanc'd that we
must naturally admire the Writings in the Man: That
if we go back to take a View of his Education, and
the Employment in Life which Fortune had cut out
for him, we shall retain the stronger Ideas of his
extensive Genius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His Father, we are told, was a considerable Dealer
in Wool; but having no fewer than ten Children, of
whom our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> was the eldest, the best education
he could afford him was no better than to qualify
him for his own Business and Employment. I cannot
affirm with any Certainty how long his Father liv'd;
but I take him to be the same Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Shakespeare</span></span>
who was living in the Year 1599, and who then, in
Honour of his Son, took out an Extract of his Family
Arms from the Herald's Office; by which it appears,
that he had been Officer and Bailiff of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span> upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Avon</span></span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Warwickshire</span></span>;
and that he enjoy'd some
hereditary Lands and Tenements, the Reward of his
Great Grandfather's faithful and approved Service to
King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> VII.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Be this as it will, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, it seems, was
bred for some Time at a Free-School; the very Free-School,
I presume, founded at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>: where, we
are told, he acquired what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> he was master of:
but that his Father being oblig'd, thro' Narrowness
of Circumstance, to withdraw him too soon from thence,
he was thereby unhappily prevented from making any
Proficiency in the Dead Languages: A Point that will
deserve some little Discussion in the Sequel of this
Dissertation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How long he continued in his Father's Way of
Business, either as an Assistant to him, or on his own
proper Account, no Notices are left to inform us:
nor have I been able to learn precisely at what Period
of Life he quitted his native <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>, and began his
Acquaintance with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stage</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order to settle in the World after a Family-manner,
he thought fit, Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rowe</span></span> acquaints us, to marry while
he was yet very young. It is certain he did so: for
by the Monument in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span> Church, erected to the
Memory of his Daughter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Susanna</span></span>, the Wife of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John
Hall</span></span>, Gentleman, it appears that she died on the 2d
Day of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July</span></span>, in the Year 1649, aged 66. So that she
was born in 1583, when her Father could not be full
19 Years old; who was himself born in the Year 1564.
Nor was she his eldest Child, for he had another
Daughter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Judith</span></span>, who was born before her, and who
was married to one Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas Quiney</span></span>. So that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> must have entred into Wedlock by that
Time he was turn'd of seventeen Years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether the Force of Inclination merely, or some
concurring Circumstances of Convenience in the Match,
prompted him to marry so early, is not easy to be
determin'd at this Distance: but 'tis probable, a View
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Interest might partly sway his Conduct on this Point:
for he married the Daughter of one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hathaway</span></span>, a substantial
Yeoman in his Neighbourhood, and she had the
Start of him in Age no less than eight Years. She
surviv'd him, notwithstanding, seven Seasons, and dy'd
that very Year in which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Players</span></span> publish'd the first
Edition of his Works in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Folio</span></span>, Anno Dom. 1623, at
the Age of 67 Years, as we likewise learn from her
Monument in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span> Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How long he continued in this kind of Settlement,
upon his own Native Spot, is not more easily to be determin'd.
But if the Tradition be true of that Extravagance
which forc'd him both to quit his Country and Way of
Living; to wit, his being engag'd, with a Knot of young
Deer-stealers, to rob the Park of Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas Lucy</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cherlecot</span></span> near
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>: the Enterprize favours so much
of Youth and Levity, we may reasonably suppose it was
before he could write full Man. Besides, considering he
has left us six and thirty Plays, at least, avow'd to be
genuine; and considering too, that he had retir'd from
the Stage, to spend the latter Part of his Days at his own
Native <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>; the Interval of Time, necessarily required
for the finishing so many Dramatic Pieces, obliges
us to suppose he threw himself very early upon the Playhouse.
And as he could, probably, contract no Acquaintance
with the Drama, while he was driving on the Affair
of Wool at home; some Time must be lost, even after he
had commenc'd Player, before he could attain Knowledge
enough in the Science to qualify himself for turning
Author.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been observ'd by Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rowe</span></span>, that amongst other
Extravagancies which our Author has given to his Sir
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaffe</span></span>, in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Merry Wives</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Windsor</span></span>, he has
made him a Deer-stealer; and that he might at the same
Time remember his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Warwickshire</span></span> Prosecutor, under the
Name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Justice Shallow</span></span>, he has given him very near the
same Coat of Arms, which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dugdale</span></span>, in his Antiquities of
that County, describes for a Family there. There are two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Coats, I observe, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dugdale</span></span>, where three Silver Fishes
are borne in the Name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lucy</span></span>; and another Coat, to the
Monument of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas Lucy</span></span>,
Son of Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William Lucy</span></span>, in
which are quarter'd in four several Divisions twelve little
Fishes, three in each Division, probably <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Luces</span></span>. This very
Coat, indeed, seems alluded to in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow's</span></span> giving the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dozen</span></span> White <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Luces</span></span>,
and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Slender</span></span> saying <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he may quarter</span></span>.
When I consider the exceeding Candour and Good-nature
of our Author (which inclin'd all the gentler Part of the
World to love him; as the Power of his Wit obliged the
Men of the most delicate Knowledge and polite Learning
to admire him); and that he should throw this humorous
Piece of Satire at his Prosecutor, at least twenty Years
after the Provocation given; I am confidently persuaded
it must be owing to an unforgiving Rancour on the Prosecutor's
Side: and if This was the Case, it were Pity but
the Disgrace of such an Inveteracy should remain as a
lasting Reproach, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span> stand as a Mark of Ridicule
to stigmatize his Malice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is said, our Author spent some Years before his
Death, in Ease, Retirement, and the Conversation of his
Friends, at his Native <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>. I could never pick up
any certain Intelligence, when he relinquish'd the Stage.
I know, it has been mistakenly thought by some, that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spenser</span></span>'s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thalia</span></span>,
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tears of the Muses</span></span>, where she
laments the Loss of her <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Willy</span></span> in the Comic Scene, has
been apply'd to our Author's quitting the Stage. But
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spenser</span></span> himself, 'tis well known, quitted the Stage of Life
in the Year 1598; and, five Years after this, we find
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s Name among the
Actors in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Jonson</span></span>'s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sejanus</span></span>, which first made its Appearance in the Year 1603.
Nor, surely, could he then have any Thoughts of retiring,
since, that very Year, a Licence under the Privy-Seal was
granted by K. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James</span></span> I. to him
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fletcher</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Burbage</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phillippes</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hemings</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Condel</span></span>, &amp;c. authorizing them to exercise
the Art of playing Comedies, Tragedies, &amp;c. as well
at their usual House call'd the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Globe</span></span> on the other Side of
the Water, as in any other Parts of the Kingdom, during
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his Majesty's Pleasure (A Copy of which Licence is
preserv'd in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rymer's
Fœdera</span></span>). Again, 'tis certain that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> did not exhibit his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span> till after the Union
was brought about, and till after King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James</span></span> I. had begun
to touch for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evil</span></span>: for 'tis plain, he has inserted Compliments,
on both those Accounts, upon his Royal Master
in that Tragedy. Nor, indeed, could the Number of the
Dramatic Pieces he produced admit of his retiring near
so early as that Period. So that what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spenser</span></span> there says,
if it relate at all to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, must hint at some occasional
Recess he made for a time upon a Disgust taken:
or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Willy</span></span>, there mention'd, must relate to some other
favourite Poet. I believe, we may safely determine that
he had not quitted in the Year 1610. For in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempest</span></span>,
our Author makes mention of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bermuda</span></span> Islands, which

in 1609, Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John
Summers</span></span> made a Voyage to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">North-America</span></span>, and discover'd
them: and afterwards invited some of his Countrymen to
settle a Plantation there. That he became the private
Gentleman, at least three Years before his Decease, is pretty
obvious from another Circumstance: I mean, from that
remarkable and well-known Story, which Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rowe</span></span> has
given us of our Author's Intimacy with Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Combe</span></span>,
an old Gentleman noted thereabouts for his Wealth and
Usury: and upon whom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> made the following
facetious Epitaph:

of the Quire of the Guild of the Holy Cross at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>,
a fair Monument is erected, having a Statue thereon cut
in Alabaster, and in a Gown, with this Epitaph. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> Distich, which is placed under the Cushion,

In 1614, the greater Part of the Town of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span> was
consumed by Fire; but our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s House, among
some others, escap'd the Flames. This House was first
built by Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hugh Clopton</span></span>, a younger Brother of an
ancient Family in that Neighbourhood, who took their
Name from the Manor of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clopton</span></span>.
Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hugh</span></span> was Sheriff
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span> in the Reign of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard</span></span> III. and Lord Mayor
in the Reign of King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry</span></span> VII. To this Gentleman
the Town of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span> is indebted for the fine Stonebridge,
consisting of fourteen Arches, which at an
extraordinary Expence he built over the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Avon</span></span>, together
with a Cause-way running at the West-end thereof; as
also for rebuilding the Chapel adjoining to his House,
and the Cross-Isle in the Church there. It is remarkable
of him, that, tho' he liv'd and dy'd a Bachelor, among
the other extensive Charities which he left both to the
City of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span> and Town of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>, he bequeath'd
considerable Legacies for the Marriage of poor Maidens
of good Name and Fame both in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>
and at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>.
Notwithstanding which large Donations in his
Life, and Bequests at his Death, as he had purchased
the Manor of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clopton</span></span>, and all the Estate of the Family,
so he left the same again to his elder Brother's Son with
a very great Addition (a Proof how well Beneficence
and Œconomy may walk hand in hand in wise Families):
Good Part of which Estate is yet in the Possession of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edward Clopton</span></span>, Esq. and Sir
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hugh Clopton</span></span>, Knt.
lineally descended from the elder Brother of the first
Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hugh</span></span>: Who particularly bequeathed to his Nephew,
by his Will, his House, by the Name of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great-House</span></span>
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratford</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Estate had now been sold out of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clopton</span></span>
Family for above a Century, at the time when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>
became the Purchaser: who, having repair'd and modell'd
it to his own Mind, chang'd the Name to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New-place</span></span>;
which the Mansion-house, since erected upon the same
Spot, at this day retains. The House and Lands, which
attended it, continued in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s Descendants to the
Time of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Restoration</span></span>: when they were repurchased by
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clopton</span></span> Family, and the Mansion now belongs to Sir
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hugh Clopton</span></span>, Knt. To the Favour of this worthy
Gentleman I owe the Knowledge of one Particular, in
Honour of our Poet's once Dwelling-house, of which,
I presume, Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rowe</span></span> never was appriz'd. When the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Civil War raged in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and
K. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Charles</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>'s
Queen was driven by the Necessity of Affairs to make
a Recess in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Warwickshire</span></span>, she kept her Court for three
Weeks in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New-place</span></span>. We may reasonably suppose it
then the best private House in the Town; and her
Majesty preferr'd it to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">College</span></span>, which was in the
Possession of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Combe</span></span> Family, who did not so strongly
favour the King's Party.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How much our Author employ'd himself in Poetry,
after his Retirement from the Stage, does not so evidently
appear: Very few posthumous Sketches of his Pen have
been recover'd to ascertain that Point. We have been
told, indeed, in Print, but not till very lately, That two
large Chests full of this Great Man's loose Papers and
Manuscripts, in the Hands of an ignorant Baker of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Warwick</span></span> (who married one of the Descendants from
our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>), were carelessly scatter'd and thrown
about, as Garret-Lumber and Litter, to the particular
Knowledge of the late Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William Bishop</span></span>, till they were
all consumed in the general Fire and Destruction of that
Town. I cannot help being a little apt to distrust the
Authority of this Tradition; because as his Wife survived
him seven Years, and as his Favourite Daughter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Susanna</span></span>
surviv'd her twenty-six Years, 'tis very improbable they
should suffer such a Treasure to be remov'd, and translated
into a remoter Branch of the Family, without a
Scrutiny first made into the Value of it. This, I say,
inclines me to distrust the Authority of the Relation:
but, notwithstanding such an apparent Improbability, if
we really lost such a Treasure, by whatever Fatality or
Caprice of Fortune they came into such ignorant and
neglectful Hands, I agree with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Relater</span></span>, the Misfortune
is wholly irreparable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To these Particulars, which regard his Person and
private Life, some few more are to be glean'd from Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rowe's</span></span> Account of his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Writings</span></span>: Let us now
take a short View of him in his publick Capacity, as a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Writer</span></span>: and, from thence, the Transition will be easy to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">State</span></span> in which his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Writings</span></span> have been handed down
to us.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No Age, perhaps, can produce an Author more various
from himself than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has been universally
acknowledged to be. The Diversity in Stile, and other
Parts of Composition, so obvious in him, is as variously
to be accounted for. His Education, we find, was at
best but begun: and he started early into a Science from
the Force of Genius, unequally assisted by acquir'd
Improvements. His Fire, Spirit, and Exuberance of
Imagination gave an impetuosity to his Pen: His Ideas
flow'd from him in a Stream rapid, but not turbulent;
copious, but not ever over-bearing its Shores. The Ease
and Sweetness of his Temper might not a little contribute
to his Facility in Writing: as his Employment, as a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Player</span></span>, gave him an Advantage and Habit of fancying
himself the very Character he meant to delineate. He
used the Helps of his Function in forming himself to
create and express that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sublime</span></span> which other Actors can
only copy, and throw out, in Action and graceful Attitude.
But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nullum sine Venia placuit
Ingenium</span></span>, says <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seneca</span></span>. The
Genius that gives us the greatest Pleasure, sometimes
stands in Need of our Indulgence. Whenever this
happens with regard to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> I would willingly
impute it to a Vice of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his Times</span></span>. We see Complaisance
enough, in our Days, paid to a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bad Taste</span></span>. So that his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clinches</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">false Wit</span></span>,
and descending beneath himself, may
have proceeded from a Deference paid to the then
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">reigning Barbarism</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have not thought it out of my Province, whenever
Occasion offer'd, to take notice of some of our Poet's
grand Touches of Nature: Some that do not appear
superficially such; but in which he seems the most deeply
instructed; and to which, no doubt, he has so much ow'd
that happy Preservation of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Characters</span></span>, for which he
is justly celebrated. Great Genius's, like his, naturally
unambitious, are satisfy'd to conceal their Art in these
Points. 'Tis the Foible of your worser Poets to make a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Parade and Ostentation of that little Science they have;
and to throw it out in the most ambitious Colours. And
whenever a Writer of this Class shall attempt to copy
these artful Concealments of our Author, and shall either
think them easy, or practised by a Writer for his Ease,
he will soon be convinced of his Mistake by the Difficulty
of reaching the Imitation of them.

Indeed, to point out, and exclaim upon, all the Beauties
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, as they come singly in Review, would be
as insipid, as endless; as tedious, as unnecessary: But the
Explanation of those Beauties that are less obvious to
common Readers, and whose Illustration depends on the
Rules of just Criticism, and an exact knowledge of human
Life, should deservedly have a Share in a general Critic
upon the Author. But, to pass over at once to another
Subject:——
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been allow'd on all hands, how far our Author
was indebted to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nature</span></span>; it is not so well agreed, how
much he ow'd to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Languages</span></span>
and acquired <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Learning</span></span>. The
Decisions on this Subject were certainly set on Foot by
the Hint from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ben Jonson</span></span>,
that he had small <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> and
less <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></span>: And from this Tradition, as it were, Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rowe</span></span> has thought fit peremptorily to declare, that, <span class="tei tei-q">“It
is without Controversy, he had no Knowledge of the
Writings of the ancient Poets, for that in his Works we
find no Traces of any thing which looks like an imitation
of the Ancients. For the Delicacy of his Taste (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">continues
He</span></span>) and the natural Bent of his own great Genius
(equal, if not superior, to some of the Best of theirs),
would certainly have led him to read and study them
with so much Pleasure, that some of their fine Images
would naturally have insinuated themselves into, and been
mix'd with his own Writings: and so his not copying
at least something from them, may be an Argument of
his never having read them.”</span> I shall leave it to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Determination of my Learned Readers, from the numerous
Passages, which I have occasionally quoted in my
Notes, in which our Poet seems closely to have imitated
the Classics, whether Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rowe</span></span>'s Assertion be so
absolutely to be depended on. The Result of the Controversy
must certainly, either way, terminate to our
Author's Honour: how happily he could imitate them,
if that Point be allowed; or how gloriously he could
think like them, without owing any thing to Imitation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tho' I should be very unwilling to allow <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>
so poor a Scholar as Many have labour'd to represent
him, yet I shall be very cautious of declaring too positively
on the other side of the Question: that is, with
regard to my Opinion of his Knowledge in the dead
languages. And therefore the Passages, that I occasionally
quote from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Classics</span></span>, shall not be urged as Proofs
that he knowingly imitated those Originals; but brought
to shew how happily he has express'd himself upon the
same Topicks. A very learned Critick of our own
Nation has declar'd, that a Sameness of Thought and
Sameness of Expression too, in Two Writers of a
different Age, can hardly happen, without a violent
Suspicion of the latter copying from his Predecessor. I
shall not therefore run any great Risque of a Censure,
tho' I should venture to hint, that the Resemblances in
Thought and Expression of our Author and an Ancient
(which we should allow to be Imitation in the One whose
learning was not question'd) may sometimes take its
Rise from Strength of Memory, and those Impressions
which he owed to the School. And if we may allow a
Possibility of This, considering that, when he quitted
the School he gave into his Father's Profession and way
of Living, and had, 'tis likely, but a slender Library of
Classical Learning; and considering what a Number of
Translations, Romances, and Legends, started about his
Time, and a little before (most of which, 'tis very
evident, he read); I think, it may easily be reconciled
why he rather schemed his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plots</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Characters</span></span> from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these more latter Informations, than went back to those
Fountains, for which he might entertain a sincere Veneration,
but to which he could not have so ready a Recourse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In touching on another Part of his Learning, as it
related to the Knowledge of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Books</span></span>, I shall
advance something that, at first sight, will very much
wear the Appearance of a Paradox. For I shall find it no
hard Matter to prove, that, from the grossest Blunders
in History, we are not to infer his real Ignorance of it:
Nor from a greater Use of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> Words, than ever any
other <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Author used, must we infer his intimate
Acquaintance with that Language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A Reader of Taste may easily observe, that tho'
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, almost in every Scene of his historical Plays,
commits the grossest Offences against Chronology,
History, and Ancient Politicks; yet This was not thro'
Ignorance, as is generally supposed, but thro' the too
powerful Blaze of his Imagination; which, when once
raised, made all acquired Knowledge vanish and disappear
before it. But this Licence in him, as I have said, must
not be imputed to Ignorance: since as often we may find
him, when Occasion serves, reasoning up to the Truth of
History; and throwing out Sentiments as justly adapted
to the Circumstances of his Subject, as to the Dignity of
his Characters, or Dictates of Nature in general.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then to come to his Knowledge of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> Tongue,

made <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span>, far more than in
any one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Author I
have seen; but we must be cautious to imagine this was
of his own doing. For the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Tongue, in this Age,
began extremely to suffer by an inundation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span>: And
this, to be sure, was occasion'd by the Pedantry of those
two Monarchs, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elizabeth</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James</span></span>, Both great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latinists</span></span>.
For it is not to be wonder'd at, if both the Court and
Schools, equal Flatterers of Power, should adapt themselves
to the Royal Taste.

But now I am touching on the Question (which has
been so frequently agitated, yet so entirely undecided) of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his Learning and Acquaintance with the Languages; an
additional Word or two naturally falls in here upon the
Genius of our Author, as compared with that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jonson</span></span>
his Contemporary. They are confessedly the greatest
Writers our Nation could ever boast of in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Drama</span></span>.
The first, we say, owed all to his prodigious natural
Genius; and the other a great deal to his Art and Learning.
This, if attended to, will explain a very remarkable
Appearance in their Writings. Besides those wonderful
Masterpieces of Art and Genius, which each has given
us, They are the Authors of other Works very unworthy
of them: But with this Difference, that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jonson</span></span>'s bad
Pieces we don't discover one single Trace of the Author of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fox</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alchemist</span></span>: but in the wild extravagant Notes
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, you every now and then encounter Strains
that recognize the divine Composer. This Difference
may be thus accounted for. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jonson</span></span>, as we said before,
owing all his Excellence to his Art, by which he sometimes
strain'd himself to an uncommon Pitch, when at other
times he unbent and play'd with his Subject, having
nothing then to support him, it is no wonder he
wrote so far beneath himself. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, indebted
more largely to Nature than the Other to acquired
Talents, in his most negligent Hours could never so
totally divest himself of his Genius, but that it would
frequently break out with astonishing Force and Splendor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As I have never propos'd to dilate farther on the
Character of my Author than was necessary to explain
the Nature and Use of this Edition, I shall proceed to
consider him as a Genius in Possession of an everlasting
Name. And how great that Merit must be, which could
gain it against all the Disadvantages of the horrid Condition
in which he had hitherto appear'd! Had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homer</span></span>,
or any other admir'd Author, first started into Publick so
maim'd and deform'd, we cannot determine whether they
had not sunk for ever under the Ignominy of such an ill
Appearance. The mangled Condition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has
been acknowledg'd by Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rowe</span></span>, who published him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indeed, but neither corrected his Text, nor collated the
old Copies. This Gentleman had Abilities, and a sufficient
Knowledge of his Author, had but his Industry been
equal to his Talents. The same mangled Condition has
been acknowledg'd too by Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>, who publish'd him
likewise, pretended to have collated the old Copies, and
yet seldom has corrected the Text but to its Injury. I
congratulate with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manes</span></span> of our Poet, that this Gentleman
has been sparing in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">indulging his private Sense</span></span>, as he
phrases it; for He who tampers with an Author whom
he does not understand, must do it at the Expence of his
Subject. I have made it evident throughout my Remarks,
that he has frequently inflicted a Wound where he intended
a Cure. He has acted with regard to our Author,
as an Editor, whom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lipsius</span></span> mentions, did with regard to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Martial</span></span>; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inventus est nescio quis</span></span>
Popa, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qui non</span></span> vitia <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ejus</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sed</span></span> ipsum <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">excidit</span></span>.
He has attack'd him like an unhandy
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Slaughterman</span></span>; and not lopp'd off
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Errors</span></span>, but the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poet</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When this is found to be Fact, how absurd must
appear the Praises of such an Editor! It seems a moot
Point, whether Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span> has
done most Injury to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>
as his Editor and Encomiast, or Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rymer</span></span> done
him Service as his Rival and Censurer. They have Both
shewn themselves in an equal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Impuissance</span></span> of suspecting, or
amending, the corrupted Passages: and tho' it be neither
Prudence to censure, or commend, what one does not
understand; yet if a man must do one when he plays the
Critick, the latter is the more ridiculous Office: And by
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> suffers most. For the natural Veneration
which we have for him, makes us apt to swallow
whatever is given us as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></span>, and set off with Encomiums;
and hence we quit all suspicions of Depravity: On the
contrary, the Censure of so divine an Author sets us upon
his Defence; and this produces an exact Scrutiny and
Examination, which ends in finding out and discriminating
the true from the spurious.

It is not with any secret Pleasure that I so frequently

animadvert on Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span> as a Critick; but there are Provocations
which a Man can never quite forget. His

that, not to dispute whether they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">should</span></em> come from a

The Indignation, perhaps, for being represented a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Block-head</span></span>,
may be as strong in us as it is in the Ladies for a
Reflexion on their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beauties</span></span>. It is certain, I am indebted
to Him for some <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">flagrant Civilities</span></span>; and I shall willingly
devote a Part of my Life to the honest Endeavour of
quitting Scores: with this Exception however, that I will
not return those Civilities in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar</span></span> Strain, but confine
myself, at least, to the Limits of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">common Decency</span></span>. I shall

than to want <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Humanity</span></span>:
and impartial Posterity may, perhaps, be of my Opinion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, to return to my Subject; which now calls upon
me to inquire into those Causes, to which the Depravations
of my Author originally may be assign'd. We are
to consider him as a Writer, of whom no authentic
Manuscript was left extant; as a Writer, whose Pieces
were dispersedly perform'd on the several <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stages</span></span> then in
Being. And it was the Custom of those Days for the
Poets to take a Price of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Players</span></span> for the Pieces They
from time to time furnish'd; and thereupon it was
suppos'd, they had no farther Right to print them without
the Consent of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Players</span></span>. As it was the Interest of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Companies</span></span> to keep their Plays unpublish'd, when any
one succeeded, there was a Contest betwixt the Curiosity
of the Town, who demanded to see it in Print, and the
Policy of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stagers</span></span>, who wish'd to secrete it within their
own Walls. Hence, many Pieces were taken down in
Short-hand, and imperfectly copied by Ear, from a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Representation</span></span>:
Others were printed from piece-meal Parts
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
surreptitiously obtain'd from the Theatres, uncorrect, and
without the Poet's Knowledge. To some of these Causes
we owe the Train of Blemishes that deform those Pieces
which stole singly into the World in our Author's Lifetime.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are still other Reasons which may be suppos'd
to have affected the whole Set. When the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Players</span></span> took
upon them to publish his Works intire, every Theatre
was ransack'd to supply the Copy; and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parts</span></span> collected,
which had gone thro' as many Changes as Performers,
either from Mutilations or Additions made to them.
Hence we derive many Chasms and Incoherences in the
Sense and Matter. Scenes were frequently transposed,
and shuffled out of their true Place, to humour the
Caprice, or suppos'd Convenience, of some particular
Actor. Hence much Confusion and Impropriety has
attended and embarrass'd the Business and Fable. To
these obvious Causes of Corruption it must be added,
That our Author has lain under the Disadvantage of
having his Errors propagated and multiplied by Time:
because, for near a Century, his Works were publish'd
from the faulty Copies, without the Assistance of any
intelligent Editor: which has been the Case likewise of
many a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Classic</span></span> Writer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Nature of any Distemper once found has generally
been the immediate Step to a Cure. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s Case
has in a great Measure resembled That of a corrupt
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Classic</span></span>; and, consequently, the Method of Cure was
likewise to bear a Resemblance. By what Means, and
with what Success, this Cure has been effected on ancient
Writers, is too well known, and needs no formal Illustration.
The Reputation, consequent on Tasks of that
Nature, invited me to attempt the Method here; with
this view, the Hopes of restoring to the Publick their
greatest Poet in his original Purity: after having so long
lain in a Condition that was a Disgrace to common Sense.
To this end I have ventur'd on a Labour, that is the first
Assay of the kind on any modern Author whatsoever.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the late Edition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milton</span></span>
by the Learned Dr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bentley</span></span>
is, in the main, a Performance of another Species. It is
plain, it was the Intention of that Great Man rather to
correct and pare off the Excrescencies of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paradise
Lost</span></span>, in the Manner that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tucca</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Varius</span></span> were employ'd
to criticize the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Æneis</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Virgil</span></span>, than to restore corrupted
Passages. Hence, therefore, may be seen either the
Iniquity or Ignorance of his Censurers, who, from some
Expressions, would make us believe, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Doctor</span></span> every
where gives us his Corrections as the original Text of the
Author; whereas the chief Turn of his Criticism is plainly
to shew the World, that if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milton</span></span> did not write as He
would have him, he ought to have wrote so.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I thought proper to premise this Observation to the
Readers, as it will shew that the Critic on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> is
of a quite different Kind. His genuine Text is for the
most part religiously adhered to, and the numerous
Faults and Blemishes, purely his own, are left as they
were found. Nothing is alter'd, but what by the clearest
Reasoning can be proved a Corruption of the true Text;
and the Alteration, a real Restoration of the genuine
Reading. Nay, so strictly have I strove to give the
true Reading, tho' sometimes not to the Advantage of
my Author, that I have been ridiculously ridicul'd for it
by Those, who either were iniquitously for turning every
thing to my Disadvantage, or else were totally ignorant
of the true Duty of an Editor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Science of Criticism, as far as it effects an Editor,
seems to be reduced to these three Classes; the Emendation
of corrupt Passages; the Explanation of obscure and
difficult ones; and an Inquiry into the Beauties and
Defects of Composition. This Work is principally
confin'd to the two former Parts: tho' there are some
Specimens interspers'd of the latter Kind, as several of
the Emendations were best supported, and several of the
Difficulties best explain'd, by taking notice of the Beauties
and Defects of the Composition peculiar to this Immortal
Poet. But this was but occasional, and for the sake
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only of perfecting the two other Parts, which were the
proper Objects of the Editor's Labour. The third lies
open for every willing Undertaker: and I shall be pleas'd
to see it the Employment of a masterly Pen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must necessarily happen, as I have formerly observ'd,
that where the Assistance of Manuscripts is wanting to set
an Author's Meaning right, and rescue him from those
Errors which have been transmitted down thro' a series
of incorrect Editions, and a long Intervention of Time,
many Passages must be desperate, and past a Cure; and
their true Sense irretrievable either to Care or the Sagacity
of Conjecture. But is there any Reason therefore to say,
That because All cannot be retriev'd, All ought to be
left desperate? We should shew very little Honesty,
or Wisdom, to play the Tyrants with an Author's Text;
to raze, alter, innovate, and overturn, at all Adventures,
and to the utter Detriment of his Sense and Meaning:
But to be so very reserved and cautious, as to interpose
no Relief or Conjecture, where it manifestly labours and
cries out for Assistance, seems, on the other hand, an
indolent Absurdity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As there are very few pages in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, upon which
some Suspicions of Depravity do not reasonably arise; I
have thought it my Duty, in the first place, by a diligent
and laborious Collation to take in the Assistances of all
the older Copies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Historical Plays</span></span>, whenever
our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Chronicles,
and in his Tragedies when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> Story, could
give any Light; no Pains have been omitted to set
Passages right by comparing my Author with his
Originals; for as I have frequently observed, he was
a close and accurate Copier where-ever his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fable</span></span> was
founded on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where-ever the Author's Sense is clear and discoverable
(tho', perchance, low and trivial), I have not by
any Innovation tamper'd with his Text, out of an
Ostentation of endeavouring to make him speak better
than the old Copies have done.

Where, thro' all the former Editions, a Passage has
labour'd under flat Nonsense and invincible Darkness, if,
by the Addition or Alteration of a Letter or two, or a
Transposition in the Pointing, I have restored to Him
both Sense and Sentiment; such Corrections, I am
persuaded, will need no Indulgence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And whenever I have taken a greater Latitude and
Liberty in amending, I have constantly endeavour'd to
support my Corrections and Conjectures by parallel
Passages and Authorities from himself, the surest Means
of expounding any Author whatsoever. <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Cette voïe

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes</span></span> (from which the common and learned
Readers of our Author, I hope, will derive some Satisfaction),
I have endeavour'd to give them a Variety in
some Proportion to their Number. Where-ever I have
ventur'd at an Emendation, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Note</span></span> is constantly subjoin'd
to justify and assert the Reason of it. Where I only
offer a Conjecture, and do not disturb the Text, I fairly
set forth my Grounds for such Conjecture, and submit it
to Judgment. Some Remarks are spent in explaining
Passages, where the Wit or Satire depends on an obscure
Point of History: Others, where Allusions are to Divinity,
Philosophy, or other Branches of Science. Some are
added to shew where there is a Suspicion of our Author
having borrow'd from the Ancients: Others, to shew
where he is rallying his Contemporaries; or where He
himself is rallied by them. And some are necessarily
thrown in, to explain an obscure and obsolete <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Term</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phrase</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></span>.
I once intended to have added a complete
and copious <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glossary</span></span>; but as I have been importun'd,
and am prepar'd, to give a correct Edition of our Author's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Poems</span></span> (in which many Terms occur that are not to be
met with in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plays</span></span>),
I thought a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glossary</span></span> to all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s
Works more proper to attend that Volume.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In reforming an infinite Number of Passages in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pointing</span></span>, where the Sense was before quite lost, I have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
frequently subjoin'd Notes to shew the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">deprav'd</span></span>, and to
prove the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">reform'd</span></span>, Pointing: a Part of Labour in this
Work which I could very willingly have spar'd myself.
May it not be objected, why then have you burden'd us
with these Notes? The Answer is obvious, and, if I
mistake not, very material. Without such Notes, these
Passages in subsequent Editions would be liable, thro' the
Ignorance of Printers and Correctors, to fall into the old
Confusion: Whereas, a Note on every one hinders all
possible Return to Depravity, and for ever secures them
in a State of Purity and Integrity not to be lost or
forfeited.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, as some Notes have been necessary to point out
the Detection of the corrupted Text, and establish the
Restoration of the genuine Readings; some others have
been as necessary for the Explanation of Passages obscure
and difficult. To understand the Necessity and Use of
this Part of my Task, some Particulars of my Author's
Character are previously to be explain'd. There are
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Obscurities</span></span> in him, which are common to him with all
Poets of the same Species; there are Others, the Issue of
the Times he liv'd in; and there are others, again, peculiar
to himself. The Nature of Comic Poetry being entirely
satirical, it busies itself more in exposing what we call
Caprice and Humour, than Vices cognizable to the Laws.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span>, from the Happiness of a free Constitution,
and a Turn of Mind peculiarly speculative and inquisitive,
are observ'd to produce more <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Humourists</span></span> and a greater
Variety of original <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Characters</span></span>, than any other People
whatsoever: And These owing their immediate Birth to
the peculiar Genius of each Age, an infinite Number of
Things alluded to, glanced at, and expos'd, must needs
become obscure, as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Characters</span></span> themselves are antiquated
and disused. An Editor therefore should be
well vers'd in the History and Manners of his Author's
Age, if he aims at doing him a Service in this Respect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wit</span></span> lying mostly in
the Assemblage of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideas</span></span>,
and in the putting Those together with Quickness and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Variety, wherein can be found any Resemblance, or Congruity,
to make up pleasant Pictures, and agreeable
Visions in the Fancy; the Writer, who aims at Wit,
must of course range far and wide for Materials. Now,
the Age in which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> liv'd, having, above all
others, a wonderful Affection to appear Learned, They
declined vulgar Images, such as are immediately fetch'd
from Nature, and rang'd thro' the Circle of the Sciences
to fetch their Ideas from thence. But as the Resemblances
of such Ideas to the Subject must necessarily lie
very much out of the common Way, and every Piece of
Wit appear a Riddle to the Vulgar; This, that should
have taught them the forced, quaint, unnatural Tract they
were in (and induce them to follow a more natural One),
was the very Thing that kept them attach'd to it. The
ostentatious Affectation of abstruse Learning, peculiar to
that Time, the Love that Men naturally have to every
Thing that looks like Mystery, fixed them down to this
Habit of Obscurity. Thus became the Poetry of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Donne</span></span>
(tho' the wittiest Man of that Age) nothing but a continued
Heap of Riddles. And our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, with all
his easy Nature about him, for want of the Knowledge of
the true Rules of Art, falls frequently into this vicious
Manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third Species of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Obscurities</span></span> which deform our
Author, as the Effects of his own Genius and Character,
are Those that proceed from his peculiar Manner of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thinking</span></span>, and as peculiar a
Manner of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cloathing</span></span> those
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thoughts</span></span>. With regard to
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thinking</span></span>, it is certain
that he had a general Knowledge of all the Sciences:
But his Acquaintance was rather That of a Traveller,
than a Native. Nothing in Philosophy was unknown
to him; but every Thing in it had the Grace and
Force of Novelty. And as Novelty is one main Source
of Admiration, we are not to wonder that He has perpetual
Allusions to the most recondite Parts of the
Sciences: and This was done not so much out of
Affectation, as the Effect of Admiration begot by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Novelty. Then, as to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Style</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diction</span></span>, we may
much more justly apply to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Shakespeare</span></span> what a celebrated
Writer has said of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Milton</span></span>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Our Language sunk
under him, and was unequal to that Greatness of Soul
which furnish'd him with such glorious Conceptions.</span></em> He
therefore frequently uses old Words, to give his Diction
an Air of Solemnity; as he coins others, to express
the Novelty and Variety of his Ideas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon every distinct Species of these <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Obscurities</span></span> I have
thought it my Province to employ a Note, for the
Service of my Author, and the Entertainment of my
Readers. A few transient Remarks too I have not
scrupled to intermix, upon the Poet's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Negligences</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Omissions</span></span> in point of Art; but I have done it always
in such a Manner as will testify my Deference and
Veneration for the immortal Author. Some Censurers
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, and particularly
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rymer</span></span>, have taught
me to distinguish betwixt the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Railer</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Critick</span></span>. The
Outrage of his Quotations is so remarkably violent, so
push'd beyond all bounds of Decency and Sober
Reasoning, that it quite carries over the Mark at which
it was levell'd. Extravagant Abuse throws off the
Edge of the intended Disparagement, and turns the
Madman's Weapon into his own Bosom. In short, as
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rymer</span></span>, This is my Opinion
of him from his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Criticisms</span></span>
on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tragedies</span></span> of the Last Age. He writes
with great Vivacity, and appears to have been a Scholar:
but, as for his Knowledge of the Art of Poetry, I
can't perceive it was any deeper than his Acquaintance
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bossu</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dacier</span></span>, from whom he has transcrib'd
many of his best Reflexions. The late Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gildon</span></span> was
one attached to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rymer</span></span> by a similar way of Thinking
and Studies. They were both of that Species of Criticks,
who are desirous of displaying their Powers rather in
finding Faults, than in consulting the Improvement of
the World: the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hypercritical</span></span> Part of the Science of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Criticism</span></span>.

and there taken of animadverting on my Author, but
that I was willing to obviate in time the splenetick
Exaggerations of my Adversaries on this Head. From
past Experiments I have reason to be conscious in
what Light this Attempt may be placed: and that
what I call a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">modest Liberty</span></span>, will, by a little of their
Dexterity, be inverted into downright <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Impudence</span></span>. From
a hundred mean and dishonest Artifices employ'd to
discredit this Edition, and to cry down its Editor, I
have all the Grounds in nature to beware of Attacks.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been my Fate, it seems, as I thought it my
Duty, to discover some <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anachronisms</span></span> in our Author;
which might have slept in Obscurity but for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this Restorer</span></span>,
as Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span> is pleas'd affectionately to stile me: as,
for Instance, where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>
is mentioned by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hector</span></span> in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Troilus</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cressida</span></span>:
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Galen</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cato</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander</span></span> the Great, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coriolanus</span></span>.
These, in Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>'s Opinion,
are Blunders, which the Illiteracy of the first Publishers
of his Works has father'd upon the Poet's Memory:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it not being at all credible, that These could be the Errors
of any Man who had the least Tincture of a School, or
the least Conversation with Such as had.</span></em> But I have
sufficiently proved, in the course of my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes</span></span>, that
such <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anachronisms</span></span> were the Effect of Poetic Licence,
rather than of Ignorance in our Poet. And if I may
be permitted to ask a modest Question by the way,
Why may not I restore an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anachronism</span></span> really made
by our Author, as well as Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span> take the Privilege
to fix others upon him, which he never had it in his
Head to make; as I may venture to affirm he had
not, in the Instance of Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Francis Drake</span></span>, to which I
have spoke in the proper Place?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span> is so kind gravely to inform us, <span class="tei tei-q">“That
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homer</span></span> in This, as in many other Places, seems to
allude to the Laws of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Athens</span></span>, where Death was the
Punishment of Adultery.”</span> But how is this significant
Observation made out? Why, who can possibly object
any Thing to the contrary?—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Does not </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Pausanias</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">
relate that </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Draco</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> the
Lawgiver to the </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Athenians</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> granted
Impunity to any Person that took Revenge upon an Adulterer?
And was it not also the Institution of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Solon</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, that if Any
One took an Adulterer in the Fact, he might use him as
he pleas'd?</span></em> These Things are very true: and to see
what a good Memory, and sound Judgment in Conjunction
can atchieve! Tho' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homer</span></span>'s Date is not determin'd
down to a single Year, yet 'tis pretty generally
agreed that he liv'd above 300 Years before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Draco</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span>: And That, it seems,
has made him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seem</span></em>
to allude to the very Laws which these Two Legislators
propounded about 300 Years after. If this Inference
be not something like an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anachronism</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prolepsis</span></span>, I'll
look once more into my Lexicons for the true Meaning
of the Words. It appears to me that somebody
besides <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mars</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Venus</span></span> has been caught in a Net by
this Episode: and I could call in other Instances to
confirm what treacherous Tackle this Net-work is, if
not cautiously handled.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How just, notwithstanding, I have been in detecting
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anachronisms</span></span> of my Author, and in defending him
for the Use of them, our late Editor seems to think,
they should rather have slept in Obscurity: and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
having discovered them is sneer'd at, as a sort of wrong-headed
Sagacity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The numerous Corrections which I have made of the
Poet's Text in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare Restor'd</span></span>, and which the
Publick have been so kind to think well of, are, in the
Appendix of Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>'s last Edition, slightingly call'd
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Various Readings, Guesses</span></span>, &amp;c. He confesses to have
inserted as many of them as he judg'd of any the least
Advantage to the Poet; but says, that the whole
amounted to about 25 Words: and pretends to have
annexed a compleat List of the rest, which were not
worth his embracing. Whoever has read my Book, will
at one Glance see, how in both these Points Veracity is
strain'd, so an Injury might but be done. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Malus, etsi

Another Expedient, to make my Work appear of a

to Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>, an
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anonymous</span></span> Writer has, like a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotch</span></span>

that his Virulence might not seem to be levelled singly at

the Libel. I was in hopes, we should have been both
abused with Smartness of Satire at least, tho' not with
Solidity of Argument; that it might have been worth
some Reply in Defence of the Science attacked. But
I may fairly say of this Author, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaffe</span></span>

of the divine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Longinus</span></span> against such a Scribler, he tells us
expressly, <span class="tei tei-q">“That to make a Judgment upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Words</span></span> (and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Writings</span></span>) is the most consummate Fruit of much Experience.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What the Publick is here to expect is a true and correct
Edition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s works cleared from the corruptions
with which they have hitherto abounded. One of the
great Admirers of this incomparable Author hath made it
the amusement of his leisure hours for many years past
to look over his writings with a careful eye, to note the
obscurities and absurdities introduced into the text, and
according to the best of his judgment to restore the
genuine sense and purity of it. In this he proposed
nothing to himself but his private satisfaction in making
his own copy as perfect as he could: but as the emendations
multiplied upon his hands, other Gentlemen equally
fond of the Author desired to see them, and some were
so kind as to give their assistance by communicating their
observations and conjectures upon difficult passages which
had occurred to them. Thus by degrees the work growing
more considerable than was at first expected, they who
had the opportunity of looking into it, too partial perhaps
in their judgment, thought it worth being made publick;
and he, who hath with difficulty yielded to their perswasions,
is far from desiring to reflect upon the late
Editors for the omissions and defects which they left to
be supplied by others who should follow them in the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
province. On the contrary, he thinks the world much
obliged to them for the progress they made in weeding
out so great a number of blunders and mistakes as they
have done, and probably he who hath carried on the work
might never have thought of such an undertaking if he
had not found a considerable part so done to his hands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From what causes it proceeded that the works of this
Author in the first publication of them were more injured
and abused than perhaps any that ever pass'd the Press,
hath been sufficiently explained in the Preface to Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>'s Edition which is here subjoined, and there needs no
more to be said upon that subject. This only the Reader
is desired to bear in mind, that as the corruptions are
more numerous and of a grosser kind than can well be
conceived but by those who have looked nearly into
them; so in the correcting them this rule hath been most
strictly observed, not to give a loose to fancy, or indulge
a licentious spirit of criticism, as if it were fit for any
one to presume to judge what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> ought to have
written, instead of endeavouring to discover truly and
retrieve what he did write: and so great caution hath
been used in this respect, that no alterations have been
made but what the sense necessarily required, what the
measure of the verse often helped to point out, and what
the similitude of words in the false reading and in the
true, generally speaking, appeared very well to justify.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of those passages are here thrown to the bottom
of the page and rejected as spurious, which were stigmatized
as such in Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>'s Edition; and it were to be
wished that more had then undergone the same sentence.
The promoter of the present Edition hath ventured to
discard but few more upon his own judgment, the most
considerable of which is that wretched piece of ribaldry in
King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry V.</span></span> put into the
mouths of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French</span></span> Princess
and an old Gentlewoman, improper enough as it is all in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French</span></span> and not intelligible to
an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> audience, and yet
that perhaps is the best thing that can be said of it.
There can be no doubt but a great deal more of that low
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stuff which disgraces the works of this great Author, was
foisted in by the Players after his death, to please the
vulgar audiences by which they subsisted: and though
some of the poor witticisms and conceits must be supposed
to have fallen from his pen, yet as he hath put them
generally into the mouths of low and ignorant people, so
it is to be remember'd that he wrote for the Stage, rude
and unpolished as it then was; and the vicious taste of
the age must stand condemned for them, since he hath
left upon record a signal proof how much he despised
them. In his Play of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Merchant of Venice</span></span> a Clown is
introduced quibbling in a miserable manner, upon which
one who bears the character of a man of sense makes the
following reflection: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">How every fool can play upon a word!
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and
discourse grow commendable in none but parrots.</span></em> He could
hardly have found stronger words to express his indignation
at those false pretences to wit then in vogue; and
therefore though such trash is frequently interspersed in
his writings, it would be unjust to cast it as an imputation
upon his taste and judgment and character as a Writer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There being many words in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> which are
grown out of use and obsolete, and many borrowed from
other languages which are not enough naturalized or
known among us, a Glossary is added at the end of the

hitherto been so many stumbling-blocks to the generality
of Readers; and where there is any obscurity in the text
not arising from the words but from a reference to some

clear up the difficulty.

With these several helps if that rich vein of sense
which runs through the works of this Author can be
retrieved in every part and brought to appear in its
true light, and if it may be hoped without presumption
that this is here effected; they who love and admire
him will receive a new pleasure, and all probably will

great honour to his country as a rare and perhaps a
singular Genius: one who hath attained an high degree
of perfection in those two great branches of Poetry,
Tragedy and Comedy, different as they are in their
natures from each other; and who may be said without
partiality to have equalled, if not excelled, in both
kinds, the best writers of any age or country who
have thought it glory enough to distinguish themselves
in either.

Since therefore other nations have taken care to
dignify the works of their most celebrated Poets with
the fairest impressions beautified with the ornaments
of sculpture, well may our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> be thought to
deserve no less consideration: and as a fresh acknowledgment
hath lately been paid to his merit, and a
high regard to his name and memory, by erecting
his Statue at a publick expence; so it is desired that
this new Edition of his works, which hath cost some
attention and care, may be looked upon as another
small monument designed and dedicated to his honour.

It hath been no unusual thing for Writers, when dissatisfied
with the Patronage or Judgment of their own
Times, to appeal to Posterity for a fair Hearing. Some
have even thought fit to apply to it in the first Instance;
and to decline Acquaintance with the Public till Envy and
Prejudice had quite subsided. But, of all the Trusters to
Futurity, commend me to the Author of the following
Poems, who not only left it to Time to do him Justice as
it would, but to find him out as it could. For, what
between too great Attention to his Profit as a Player, and
too little to his Reputation as a Poet, his Works, left to
the Care of Door-keepers and Prompters, hardly escaped
the common Fate of those Writings, how good soever,
which are abandon'd to their own Fortune, and unprotected
by Party or Cabal. At length, indeed, they
struggled into Light; but so disguised and travested,
that no classic Author, after having run ten secular
Stages thro' the blind Cloisters of Monks and Canons,
ever came out in half so maimed and mangled a Condition.
But for a full Account of his Disorders, I refer the Reader
to the excellent Discourse which follows, and turn myself
to consider the Remedies that have been applied to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s Works, when they escaped the Players, did
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not fall into much better Hands when they came amongst
Printers and Booksellers: who, to say the Truth, had, at
first, but small Encouragement for putting him into a
better Condition. The stubborn Nonsense, with which
he was incrusted, occasioned his lying long neglected
amongst the common Lumber of the Stage. And when
that resistless Splendor, which now shoots all around him,
had, by degrees, broke thro' the Shell of those Impurities,
his dazzled Admirers became as suddenly insensible to the
extraneous Scurf that still stuck upon him, as they had
been before to the native Beauties that lay under it. So
that, as then he was thought not to deserve a Cure, he
was now supposed not to need any.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His growing Eminence, however, required that he
should be used with Ceremony: And he soon had his
Appointment of an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Editor</span></span> in form. But the Bookseller,
whose dealing was with Wits, having learnt of them, I
know not what silly Maxim, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">none but a Poet should
presume to meddle with a Poet</span></em>, engaged the ingenious Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rowe</span></span> to undertake this Employment. A Wit indeed he
was; but so utterly unacquainted with the whole Business
of Criticism, that he did not even collate or consult the
first Editions of the Work he undertook to publish; but
contented himself with giving us a meagre Account of the
Author's Life, interlarded with some common-place Scraps
from his Writings. The Truth is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s Condition
was yet but ill understood. The Nonsense, now, by
consent, received for his own, was held in a kind of
Reverence for its Age and Author: and thus it continued,
till another great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poet</span></span> broke the Charm; by
shewing us, that the higher we went, the less of it was
still to be found.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the Proprietors, not discouraged by their first
unsuccessful Effort, in due time made a second; and,
tho' they still stuck to their Poets, with infinitely more
Success in their Choice of Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Pope</span></span>. Who, by the mere
force of an uncommon Genius, without any particular
Study or Profession of this Art, discharged the great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Parts of it so well as to make his Edition the best
Foundation for all further Improvements. He separated
the genuine from the spurious Plays: And, with equal
Judgment, tho' not always with the same Success,
attempted to clear the genuine Plays from the interpolated
Scenes: He then consulted the old Editions; and, by a
careful Collation of them, rectified the faulty, and supplied
the imperfect Reading, in a great number of places: And
lastly, in an admirable Preface, hath drawn a general, but
very lively, Sketch of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s poetic Character; and,
in the corrected Text, marked out those peculiar Strokes
of Genius which were most proper to support and
illustrate that Character. Thus far Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Pope</span></span>. And
altho' much more was to be done before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>
could be restored to himself (such as amending the
corrupted Text where the printed Books afford no
Assistance; explaining his licentious Phraseology and
obscure Allusions; and illustrating the Beauties of his
Poetry); yet, with great Modesty and Prudence, our
illustrious Editor left this to the Critic by Profession.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But nothing will give the common Reader a better
idea of the Value of Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>'s Edition, than the two
Attempts which have been since made, by Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theobald</span></span>
and Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas Hanmer</span></span>, in Opposition to it.
Who, altho' they concerned themselves only in the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> of these three Parts of Criticism, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">restoring the
Text</span></em> (without any Conception of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em>, or venturing
even to touch upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>), yet succeeded
so very ill in it, that they left their Author in ten
times a worse Condition than they found him. But,
as it was my ill Fortune to have some accidental
Connexions with these two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gentlemen</span></span>, it will be incumbent
on me to be a little more particular concerning
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The One was recommended to me as a poor Man;
the Other as a poor Critic: and to each of them,
at different times, I communicated a great number of
Observations, which they managed, as they saw fit, to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Relief of their several Distresses. As to Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theobald</span></span>, who wanted Money, I allowed him to print
what I gave him for his own Advantage: and he
allowed himself in the Liberty of taking one Part for
his own, and sequestering another for the Benefit, as I
supposed, of some future Edition. But, as to the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oxford Editor</span></span>, who wanted nothing but what he
might very well be without, the Reputation of a
Critic, I could not so easily forgive him for trafficking
with my Papers without my Knowledge; and, when
that Project fail'd, for employing a number of my
Conjectures in his Edition against my express Desire
not to have that Honour done unto me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theobald</span></span> was naturally turned to Industry and
Labour. What he read he could transcribe: but, as
what he thought, if ever he did think, he could but
ill express, so he read on; and by that means got a
Character of Learning, without risquing, to every
Observer, the Imputation of wanting a better Talent.
By a punctilious Collation of the old Books, he corrected
what was manifestly wrong in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">latter</span></em> Editions,
by what was manifestly right in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earlier</span></em>. And this
is his real merit; and the whole of it. For where
the Phrase was very obsolete or licentious in the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em> Books, or only slightly corrupted in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em>,
he wanted sufficient Knowledge of the Progress and
various Stages of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Tongue, as well as
Acquaintance with the Peculiarity of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s
Language, to understand what was right; nor had he
either common Judgment to see, or critical Sagacity
to amend, what was manifestly faulty. Hence he
generally exerts his conjectural Talent in the wrong
Place: He tampers with what is found in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em>
Books; and, in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">old</span></em> ones, omits all Notice of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Variations</span></span> the Sense of which he did not understand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oxford Editor</span></span> came to think himself qualified
for this Office, from which his whole Course of
Life had been so remote, is still more difficult to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conceive. For whatever Parts he might have either
of Genius or Erudition, he was absolutely ignorant
of the Art of Criticism, as well as the Poetry of that
Time, and the Language of his Author: And so far
from a Thought of examining the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> Editions, that
he even neglected to compare Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>'s, from which
he printed his own, with Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theobald</span></span>'s; whereby he
lost the Advantage of many fine Lines which the other
had recovered from the old Quartos. Where he
trusts to his own Sagacity, in what affects the Sense,
his Conjectures are generally absurd and extravagant,
and violating every Rule of Criticism. Tho', in this
Rage of Correcting, he was not absolutely destitute
of all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art</span></span>. For, having a Number of my Conjectures
before him, he took as many of them as he saw fit,
to work upon; and by changing them to something,
he thought, synonymous or similar, he made them his
own; and so became a Critic at a cheap Expence.
But how well he hath succeeded in this, as likewise
in his Conjectures which are properly his own, will be
seen in the course of my Remarks: Tho', as he hath
declined to give the Reasons for his Interpolations, he
hath not afforded me so fair a hold of him as Mr.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theobald</span></span> hath done, who was less cautious. But his
principal Object was to reform his Author's Numbers;
and this, which he hath done, on every Occasion, by
the Insertion or Omission of a set of harmless unconcerning
Expletives, makes up the gross Body of his
innocent Corrections. And so, in spite of that extreme
Negligence in Numbers which distinguishes the first
Dramatic Writers, he hath tricked up the old Bard,
from Head to Foot, in all the finical Exactness of a
modern Measurer of Syllables.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the rest, all the Corrections which these two
Editors have made on any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reasonable</span></em> Foundation, are
here admitted into the Text, and carefully assigned
to their respective Authors: A piece of Justice which
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oxford Editor</span></span> never did; and
which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Other</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was not always scrupulous in observing towards me.
To conclude with them in a word, They separately
possessed those two Qualities which, more than any
other, have contributed to bring the Art of Criticism
into disrepute, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dulness of Apprehension</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Extravagance
of Conjecture</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am now to give some Account of the present
Undertaking. For as to all those Things which have
been published under the titles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essays</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Remarks</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observations</span></span>, &amp;c. on
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>, (if you except some
critical Notes on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span>, given as a Specimen of a
projected Edition, and written, as appears, by a Man
of Parts and Genius) the rest are absolutely below a
serious Notice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole a Critic can do for an Author who deserves
his Service, is to correct the faulty Text; to remark
the Peculiarities of Language; to illustrate the obscure
Allusions; and to explain the Beauties and Defects
of Sentiment or Composition. And surely, if ever
Author had a Claim to this Service, it was our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>:
Who, widely excelling in the Knowledge of
Human Nature, hath given to his infinitely varied
Pictures of it, such Truth of Design, such Force of
Drawing, such Beauty of Colouring, as was hardly
ever equalled by any Writer, whether his Aim was
the Use, or only the Entertainment of Mankind. The
Notes in this Edition, therefore, take in the whole
Compass of Criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. The first sort is employed in restoring the Poet's
genuine Text; but in those Places only where it
labours with inextricable Nonsense. In which, how
much soever I may have given Scope to critical Conjecture,
where the old Copies failed me, I have indulged
nothing to Fancy or Imagination; but have religiously
observed the severe Canons of literal Criticism; as
may be seen from the Reasons accompanying every
Alteration of the common Text. Nor would a
different Conduct have become a Critic whose greatest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Attention, in this part, was to vindicate the established
Reading from Interpolations occasioned by the fanciful
Extravagancies of others. I once intended to have
given the Reader a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">body of Canons</span></span>, for literal Criticism,
drawn out in form; as well such as concern the Art
in general, as those that arise from the Nature and
Circumstances of our Author's Works in particular.
And this for two Reasons. First, To give the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unlearned
Reader</span></span> a just Idea, and consequently a better
Opinion of the Art of Criticism, now sunk very low
in the popular Esteem, by the Attempts of some who
would needs exercise it without either natural or
acquired Talents; and by the ill Success of others,
who seemed to have lost both, when they came to try
them upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> Authors. Secondly, To deter the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unlearned Writer</span></span> from wantonly trifling with an Art he
is a Stranger to, at the Expence of his own Reputation,
and the Integrity of the Text of established
Authors. But these Uses may be well supplied by
what is occasionally said upon the Subject, in the
Course of the following Remarks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. The second sort of Notes consists in an Explanation
of the Author's Meaning, when, by one or more of
these Causes, it becomes obscure; either from a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">licentious
Use of Terms</span></span>; or a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hard or ungrammatical Construction</span></span>;
or lastly, from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">far-fetch'd or quaint Allusions</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. This licentious Use of Words is almost peculiar
to the Language of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>. To common Terms
he hath affixed Meanings of his own, unauthorised by
Use, and not to be justified by Analogy. And this
Liberty he hath taken with the noblest Parts of
Speech, such as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mixed-modes</span></span>; which, as they are most
susceptible of Abuse, so their Abuse most hurts the
Clearness of the Discourse. The Critics (to whom
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s Licence was still as much a Secret as his
Meaning, which that Licence had obscured) fell into
two contrary Mistakes; but equally injurious to his
Reputation and his Writings. For some of them,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
observing a Darkness that pervaded his whole Expression,
have censured him for Confusion of Ideas
and Inaccuracy of reasoning. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In the Neighing of a
Horse (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">says</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> Rymer), or in the Growling of a Mastiff, there
is a Meaning, there is a lively Expression, and, may I
say, more Humanity than many times in the tragical
Flights of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Shakespear</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">.</span></span> The Ignorance of which Censure
is of a Piece with its Brutality. The Truth is,
no one thought clearer, or argued more closely than
this immortal Bard. But his Superiority of Genius
less needing the Intervention of Words in the Act
of Thinking, when he came to draw out his Contemplations
into Discourse, he took up (as he was
hurried on by the Torrent of his Matter) with the
first Words that lay in his Way; and if, amongst
these, there were two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mixed-modes</span></span> that had but a
principal Idea in common, it was enough for him;
he regarded them as synonymous, and would use the
one for the other without Fear or Scruple.—Again,
there have been others, such as the two last Editors,
who have fallen into a contrary Extreme, and regarded
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s Anomalies (as we may call them)
amongst the Corruptions of his Text; which, therefore,
they have cashiered in great Numbers, to make
room for a Jargon of their own. This hath put me
to additional Trouble; for I had not only their Interpolations
to throw out again, but the genuine Text
to replace, and establish in its stead; which, in many
Cases, could not be done without shewing the peculiar
Sense of the Terms, and explaining the Causes which
led the Poet to so perverse a use of them. I had it
once, indeed, in my Design, to give a general alphabetic
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glossary</span></span> of these Terms; but as each of them is
explained in its proper Place, there seemed the less
Occasion for such an Index.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Poet's hard and unnatural Construction had
a different Original. This was the Effect of mistaken
Art and Design. The Public Taste was in its Infancy;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and delighted (as it always does during that State) in
the high and turgid; which leads the Writer to
disguise a vulgar expression with hard and forced
construction, whereby the Sentence frequently becomes
cloudy and dark. Here, his Critics shew their modesty,
and leave him to himself. For the arbitrary change
of a Word doth little towards dispelling an obscurity
that ariseth, not from the licentious use of a single
Term, but from the unnatural arrangement of a whole
Sentence. And they risqued nothing by their silence.
For <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> was too clear in Fame to be suspected
of a want of Meaning; and too high in Fashion for
any one to own he needed a Critic to find it out.
Not but, in his best works, we must allow, he is often
so natural and flowing, so pure and correct, that he
is even a model for stile and language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. As to his far-fetched and quaint Allusions, these are
often a cover to common thoughts; just as his hard construction
is to common expression. When they are not
so, the Explanation of them has this further advantage,
that, in clearing the Obscurity, you frequently discover
some latent conceit not unworthy of his Genius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. The third and last sort of Notes is concerned
in a critical explanation of the Author's Beauties and
Defects; but chiefly of his Beauties, whether in Stile,
Thought, Sentiment, Character, or Composition. An
odd humour of finding fault hath long prevailed
amongst the Critics; as if nothing were worth <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">remarking</span></em>
that did not, at the same time, deserve to be
reproved. Whereas the public Judgment hath less
need to be assisted in what it shall reject, than in
what it ought to prize; Men being generally more
ready at spying Faults than in discovering Beauties.
Nor is the value they set upon a Work, a certain
proof that they understand it. For 'tis ever seen,
that half a dozen Voices of credit give the lead: And
if the Publick chance to be in good humour, or the
Author much in their favour, the People are sure to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
follow. Hence it is that the true Critic hath so frequently
attached himself to Works of established
reputation; not to teach the World to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">admire</span></em>, which,
in those circumstances, to say the truth, they are apt
enough to do of themselves; but to teach them how
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with reason to admire</span></em>: No easy matter, I will assure
you, on the subject in question: For tho' it be very
true, as Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span> hath
observed, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear is the
fairest and fullest subject for criticism</span></em>, yet it is not such
a sort of criticism as may be raised mechanically on
the Rules which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dacier</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rapin</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bossu</span></span> have collected
from Antiquity; and of which such kind of Writers
as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rymer</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gildon</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dennis</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oldmixon</span></span>, have only
gathered and chewed the Husks: nor on the other
hand is it to be formed on the plan of those crude
and superficial Judgments, on books and things, with
which a certain celebrated Paper so much abounds;
too good indeed to be named with the Writers last

These, such as they are, were amongst my younger

He was desirous I should give a new Edition of this Poet,
as he thought it might contribute to put a stop to a prevailing
folly of altering the Text of celebrated Authors
without Talents or Judgment. And he was willing that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> Edition should be melted down into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mine</span></em>, as it would,

his Notes are given, with his name annexed; the Scenes
are divided according to his regulation; and the most
beautiful passages distinguished, as in his book, with
inverted commas. In imitation of him, I have done the

If, from all this, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> or good Letters have
received any advantage, and the Public any benefit or
entertainment, the thanks are due to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proprietors</span></span>, who
have been at the expence of procuring this Edition. And
I should be unjust to several deserving Men of a reputable
and useful Profession, if I did not, on this occasion,
acknowledge the fair dealing I have always found amongst
them; and profess my sense of the unjust Prejudice
which lies against them; whereby they have been,
hitherto, unable to procure that security for their
Property, which they see the rest of their Fellow-Citizens
enjoy: A prejudice in part arising from the frequent
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Piracies</span></span> (as they are called) committed by Members of
their own Body. But such kind of Members no Body is
without. And it would be hard that this should be
turned to the discredit of the honest part of the Profession,
who suffer more from such Injuries than any other men.
It hath, in part too, arisen from the clamours of profligate
Scriblers, ever ready, for a piece of Money, to prostitute
their bad sense for or against any Cause prophane or
sacred; or in any Scandal public or private: These
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
meeting with little encouragement from Men of account
in the Trade (who even in this enlightened Age are not

But I should now, perhaps, rather think of my own
Apology, than busy myself in the defence of others. I
shall have some <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tartuffe</span></span> ready, on the first appearance of
this Edition, to call out again, and tell me, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I suffer
myself to be wholly diverted from my purpose by these matters
less suitable to my clerical Profession</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, but,”</span> says a

part? Withdraw yourself, again, as you are bid, into the
clerical Pale; examine the Records of sacred and profane
Antiquity; and, on them, erect a Work to the confusion
of Infidelity.”</span> Why, I have done all this, and more:
And hear now what the same Men have said to it. They
tell me, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I have wrote to the wrong and injury of Religion,
and furnished out more handles for Unbelievers</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh now
the secret's out; and you may have your pardon, I find,
upon easier terms. 'Tis only, to write no more.”</span>—Good
Gentlemen! and shall I not oblige them? They
would gladly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">obstruct</span></em> my way to those things which every
Man, who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">endeavours well</span></em> in his Profession, must needs
think he has some claim to, when he sees them given to
those who never did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">endeavour</span></em>; at the same time that
they would <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deter</span></em> me from taking those advantages which
Letters enable me to procure for myself. If then I am to
write no more (tho' as much out of my Profession as
they may please to represent this Work, I suspect their
modesty would not insist on a scrutiny of our several
applications of this profane profit and their purer gains); if,
I say, I am to write no more, let me at least give the
Public, who have a better pretence to demand it of me,
some reason for my presenting them with these amusements.
Which, if I am not much mistaken, may be
excused by the best and fairest <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Examples</span></span>; and, what is
more, may be justified on the surer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason of things</span></em>.

The great Saint <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Chrysostom</span></span>, a name consecrated to
immortality by his Virtue and Eloquence, is known to
have been so fond of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristophanes</span></span> as to wake with him at
his studies, and to sleep with him under his pillow: and I
never heard that this was objected either to his Piety or
his Preaching, not even in those times of pure Zeal and
primitive Religion. Yet, in respect of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span>'s great
sense, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristophanes</span></span>'s best wit is but buffoonry; and, in
comparison of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristophanes</span></span>'s Freedoms,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> writes
with the purity of a Vestal. But they will say, St.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chrysostom</span></span> contracted a fondness
for the comic Poet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for
the sake of his Greek</span></span>. To this, indeed, I have nothing to
reply. Far be it from me to insinuate so unscholarlike a

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></span> had for his

and language peculiar to Grammarians of a certain order,
hath decreed, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the History and

I fly, then, to a higher Example, much nearer home,
and still more in point, The famous University of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Oxford</span></span>. This illustrious Body, which hath long so
justly held, and, with such equity, dispensed, the chief
honours of the learned World, thought good Letters so
much interested in correct Editions of the best <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span>
Writers, that they, very lately, in their publick Capacity,
undertook <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, of this very Author, by subscription. And
if the Editor hath not discharged his Task with suitable
abilities for one so much honoured by them, this was not
their fault but his, who thrust himself into the employment.
After such an Example, it would be weakening
any defence to seek further for Authorities. All that can
be now decently urged is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason of the thing</span></em>; and this I
shall do, more for the sake of that truly venerable Body
than my own.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of all the literary exercitations of speculative Men,
whether designed for the use or entertainment of the
World, there are none of so much importance, or what
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are more our immediate concern, than those which let us
into the knowledge of our Nature. Others may exercise
the Reason, or amuse the Imagination; but these only
can improve the Heart, and form the human Mind to
Wisdom. Now, in this Science, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespear</span></span> is confessed
to occupy the foremost place; whether we consider
the amazing sagacity with which he investigates every
hidden spring and wheel of human Action; or his happy
manner of communicating this knowledge, in the just and
living paintings which he has given us of all our Passions,
Appetites, and Pursuits. These afford a lesson which
can never be too often repeated, or too constantly inculcated;
And, to engage the Reader's due attention to it,
hath been one of the principal objects of this Edition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As this Science (whatever profound Philosophers may
think) is, to the rest, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in Things</span></em>; so, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in Words</span></em> (whatever
supercilious Pedants may talk), every one's mother tongue
is to all other Languages. This hath still been the Sentiment
of Nature and true Wisdom. Hence, the greatest
men of Antiquity never thought themselves better employed
than in cultivating their own country idiom. So
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lycurgus</span></span> did honour to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sparta</span></span>, in giving the first compleat
Edition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homer</span></span>; and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cicero</span></span>, to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>, in correcting the
Works of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lucretius</span></span>. Nor do we want Examples of the
same good sense in modern Times, even amidst the cruel
inrodes that Art and Fashion have made upon Nature
and the simplicity of Wisdom. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ménage</span></span>, the greatest
name in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span> for all kind of philologic Learning, prided
himself in writing critical Notes on their best lyric Poet,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Malherbe</span></span>: And our greater
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Selden</span></span>, when he thought it
might reflect credit on his Country, did not disdain even
to comment a very ordinary Poet, one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Michael Drayton</span></span>.
But the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> tongue, at this Juncture, deserves and
demands our particular regard. It hath, by means of the
many excellent Works of different kinds composed in it,
engaged the notice, and become the study, of almost every
curious and learned Foreigner, so as to be thought even
a part of literary accomplishment. This must needs
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
make it deserving of a critical attention: And its being
yet destitute of a Test or Standard to apply to, in cases of
doubt or difficulty, shews how much it wants that attention.
For we have neither <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Grammar</span></span>
nor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dictionary</span></span>,
neither Chart nor Compass, to guide us through this wide
sea of Words. And indeed how should we? since both
are to be composed and finished on the Authority of our
best established Writers. But their Authority can be of
little use till the Text hath been correctly settled, and the
Phraseology critically examined. As, then, by these aids,
a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grammar</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dictionary</span></span>, planned upon the best rules of
Logic and Philosophy (and none but such will deserve
the name), are to be procured; the forwarding of this will
be a general concern: For, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quintilian</span></span> observes, <span class="tei tei-q">“Verborum
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proprietas</span></em> ac <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia</span></em> omnibus, qui sermonem
curæ habent, debet esse communis.”</span> By this way, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Italians</span></span> have brought their tongue to a degree of Purity
and Stability which no living Language ever attained unto
before. It is with pleasure I observe, that these things
now begin to be understood amongst ourselves; and that
I can acquaint the Public, we may soon expect very
elegant Editions of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fletcher</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milton</span></span>'s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paradise Lost</span></span>
from Gentlemen of distinguished Abilities and Learning.
But this interval of good sense, as it may be short, is
indeed but new. For I remember to have heard of a
very learned Man, who, not long since, formed a design
of giving a more correct Edition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spenser</span></span>; and, without
doubt, would have performed it well; but he was dissuaded
from his purpose by his Friends, as beneath the
dignity of a Professor of the occult Sciences. Yet these
very Friends, I suppose, would have thought it had added
lustre to his high Station, to have new-furbished out
some dull northern Chronicle, or dark Sibylline Ænigma.
But let it not be thought that what is here said insinuates
any thing to the discredit of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span> criticism. If
the follies of particular Men were sufficient to bring any
branch of Learning into disrepute, I don't know any that
would stand in a worse situation than that for which I now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apologize. For I hardly think there ever appeared, in
any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">learned</span></em> Language, so execrable a heap of nonsense,
under the name of Commentaries, as hath been lately
given us on a certain satyric Poet, of the last Age, by
his Editor and Coadjutor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am sensible how unjustly the very best <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">classical</span></em> Critics
have been treated. It is said that our great Philosopher
spoke with much contempt of the two finest Scholars of
this Age, Dr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bentley</span></span> and
Bishop <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hare</span></span>, for squabbling, as
he expressed it, about an old Play-book; meaning, I
suppose, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Terence</span></span>'s Comedies. But this Story is unworthy
of him; tho' well enough suiting the fanatic turn of the
wild Writer that relates it; such censures are amongst
the follies of men immoderately given over to one
Science, and ignorantly undervaluing all the rest.
Those learned Critics might, and perhaps did, laugh in
their turn (tho' still, sure, with the same indecency and
indiscretion) at that incomparable Man, for wearing out
a long Life in poring through a Telescope. Indeed, the
weaknesses of Such are to be mentioned with reverence.
But who can bear, without indignation, the fashionable
cant of every trifling Writer, whose insipidity passes, with
himself, for politeness, for pretending to be shocked, forsooth,
with the rude and savage air of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vulgar</span></em> Critics;
meaning such as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Muretus</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scaliger</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Casaubon</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Salmasius</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spanheim</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bentley</span></span>. When, had it not been for the deathless
labours of such as these, the western World, at the
revival of Letters, had soon fallen back again into a state
of ignorance and barbarity as deplorable as that from
which Providence had just redeemed it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To conclude with an observation of a fine Writer and
great Philosopher of our own; which I would gladly
bind, tho' with all honour, as a Phylactery, on the Brow

That praises are without reason lavished on the dead,
and that the honours due only to excellence are paid to
antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by
those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for
eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who,
being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients,
are willing to hope from posterity what the present
age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which
is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the
notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence
it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some
seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long
preserved, without considering that time has sometimes
co-operated with chance; all perhaps are more willing to
honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates
genius through the shades of age, as the eye
surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great
contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns,
and the beauties of the ancients. While an author is yet
living, we estimate his powers by his worst performance;
and when he is dead, we rate them by his best.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To works, however, of which the excellence is not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to
works not raised upon principles demonstrative and
scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and
experience, no other test can be applied than length of
duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind
have long possessed they have often examined and compared,
and if they persist to value the possession, it is
because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in
its favour. As among the works of nature no man can
properly call a river deep, or a mountain high, without
the knowledge of many mountains, and many rivers; so
in the production of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent
till it has been compared with other works of the same
kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power,
and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years;
but works tentative and experimental must be estimated
by their proportion to the general and collective ability of
man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours.
Of the first building that was raised, it might be with
certainty determined that it was round or square; but
whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred
to time. The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once
discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we
yet know not to transcend the common limits of human
intelligence, but by remarking that nation after nation,
and century after century, has been able to do little more
than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and
paraphrase his sentiments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reverence due to writings that have long subsisted
arises therefore not from any credulous confidence in the
superior wisdom of past ages, or gloomy persuasion of
the degeneracy of mankind, but is the consequence of
acknowledged and indubitable positions, that what has
been longest known has been most considered, and what
is most considered is best understood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The poet, of whose works I have undertaken the
revision, may now begin to assume the dignity of an
ancient, and claim the privilege of an established fame
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his
century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literary
merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from
personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions,
have for many years been lost; and every topick of
merriment or motive of sorrow, which the modes of
artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes
which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and
competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships
and his enmities has perished; his works support no
opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with
invectives; they can neither indulge vanity, nor gratify
malignity; but are read without any other reason than
the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as
pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or
passion, they have past through variations of taste and
changes of manners, and, as they devolved from one
generation to another, have received new honours at
every transmission.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But because human judgment, though it be gradually
gaining upon certainty, never becomes infallible; and
approbation, though long continued, may yet be only the
approbation of prejudice or fashion; it is proper to
inquire, by what peculiarities of excellence Shakespeare
has gained and kept the favour of his countrymen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nothing can please many, and please long, but just
representations of general nature. Particular manners
can be known to few, and therefore few only can judge
how nearly they are copied. The irregular combinations
of fanciful invention may delight awhile, by that novelty
of which the common satiety of life sends us all in quest;
but the pleasures of sudden wonder are soon exhausted, and
the mind can only repose on the stability of truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shakespeare is above all writers, at least above all
modern writers, the poet of nature; the poet that holds
up to his readers a faithful mirror of manners and of
life. His characters are not modified by the customs of
particular places, unpractised by the rest of the world;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the peculiarities of studies or professions, which can
operate but upon small numbers; or by the accidents of
transient fashions or temporary opinions: they are the
genuine progeny of common humanity, such as the world
will always supply, and observation will always find. His
persons act and speak by the influence of those general
passions and principles by which all minds are agitated,
and the whole system of life is continued in motion. In
the writings of other poets a character is too often an
individual; in those of Shakespeare it is commonly a
species.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is from this wide extension of design that so much
instruction is derived. It is this which fills the plays of
Shakespeare with practical axioms and domestick wisdom.
It was said of Euripides, that every verse was a precept;
and it may be said of Shakespeare, that from his works
may be collected a system of civil and œconomical
prudence. Yet his real power is not shewn in the
splendor of particular passages, but by the progress of
his fable, and the tenor of his dialogue; and he that tries
to recommend him by select quotations, will succeed like
the pedant in Heirocles, who, when he offered his house
to sale, carried a brick in his pocket as a specimen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will not easily be imagined how much Shakespeare
excels in accommodating his sentiments to real life, but
by comparing him with other authors. It was observed
of the ancient schools of declamation, that the more
diligently they were frequented, the more was the student
disqualified for the world, because he found nothing there
which he should ever meet in any other place. The same
remark may be applied to every stage but that of Shakespeare.
The theatre, when it is under any other direction,
is peopled by such characters as were never seen, conversing
in a language which was never heard, upon topicks
which will never arise in the commerce of mankind. But
the dialogue of this author is often so evidently determined
by the incident which produces it, and is pursued with so
much ease and simplicity, that it seems scarcely to claim
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the merit of fiction, but to have been gleaned by diligent
selection out of common conversation, and common
occurrences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon every other stage the universal agent is love,
by whose power all good and evil is distributed, and
every action quickened or retarded. To bring a lover,
a lady, and a rival into the fable; to entangle them in
contradictory obligations, perplex them with oppositions
of interest, and harrass them with violence of desires
inconsistent with each other; to make them meet in
rapture, and part in agony; to fill their mouths with
hyperbolical joy and outrageous sorrow; to distress
them as nothing human ever was distressed; to deliver
them as nothing human ever was delivered, is the
business of a modern dramatist. For this, probability
is violated, life is misrepresented, and language is
depraved. But love is only one of many passions, and
as it has no great influence upon the sum of life, it
has little operation in the dramas of a poet who
caught his ideas from the living world, and exhibited
only what he saw before him. He knew that any
other passion, as it was regular or exorbitant, was a
cause of happiness or calamity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Characters thus ample and general were not easily
discriminated and preserved, yet perhaps no poet ever
kept his personages more distinct from each other.
I will not say with Pope, that every speech may be
assigned to the proper speaker, because many speeches
there are which have nothing characteristical; but,
perhaps, though some may be equally adapted to every
person, it will be difficult to find any that can be
properly transferred from the present possessor to
another claimant. The choice is right, when there is
reason for choice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other dramatists can only gain attention by hyperbolical
or aggravated characters, by fabulous and
unexampled excellence or depravity, as the writers of
barbarous romances invigorated the reader by a giant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a dwarf; and he that should form his expectation
of human affairs from the play, or from the tale, would
be equally deceived. Shakespeare has no heroes; his
scenes are occupied only by men, who act and speak
as the reader thinks that he should himself have spoken
or acted on the same occasion: even where the agency
is super-natural, the dialogue is level with life. Other
writers disguise the most natural passions and most
frequent incidents; so that he who contemplates them
in the book will not know them in the world: Shakespeare
approximates the remote, and familiarizes the
wonderful; the event which he represents will not
happen, but if it were possible, its effects would probably
be such as he has assigned; and it may be said that
he has not only shewn human nature as it acts in real
exigences, but as it would be found in trials to which
it cannot be exposed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This therefore is the praise of Shakespeare, that his
drama is the mirror of life; that he who has mazed
his imagination, in following the phantoms which other
writers raise up before him, may here be cured of his
delirious ecstasies, by reading human sentiments in
human language; by scenes from which a hermit
may estimate the transactions of the world, and a
confessor predict the progress of the passions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His adherence to general nature has exposed him to
the censure of criticks, who form their judgments upon
narrower principles. Dennis and Rhymer think his
Romans not sufficiently Roman; and Voltaire censures
his kings as not completely royal. Dennis is offended
that Menenius, a senator of Rome, should play the
buffoon; and Voltaire perhaps thinks decency violated
when the Danish usurper is represented as a drunkard.
But Shakespeare always makes nature predominate over
accident; and if he preserves the essential character,
is not very careful of distinctions superinduced and
adventitious. His story requires Romans or kings, but
he thinks only on men. He knew that Rome, like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every other city, had men of all dispositions; and
wanting a buffoon, he went into the senate-house for
that which the senate-house would certainly have
afforded him. He was inclined to shew an usurper
and a murderer not only odious, but despicable; he
therefore added drunkenness to his other qualities,
knowing that kings love wine like other men, and that
wine exerts its natural power upon kings. These are
the petty cavils of petty minds; a poet overlooks the
casual distinction of country and condition, as a painter,
satisfied with the figure, neglects the drapery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The censure which he has incurred by mixing comick
and tragick scenes, as it extends to all his works,
deserves more consideration. Let the fact be first
stated, and then examined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shakespeare's plays are not in the rigorous and critical
sense either tragedies or comedies, but compositions of
a distinct kind; exhibiting the real state of sublunary
nature, which partakes of good and evil, joy and
sorrow, mingled with endless variety of proportion and
innumerable modes of combination; and expressing the
course of the world, in which the loss of one is the
gain of another; in which, at the same time, the
reveller is hasting to his wine, and the mourner burying
his friend; in which the malignity of one is
sometimes defeated by the frolick of another; and
many mischiefs and many benefits are done and hindered
without design.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Out of this chaos of mingled purposes and casualties,
the ancient poets, according to the laws which custom
had prescribed, selected some the crimes of men, and
some their absurdities; some the momentous vicissitudes
of life, and some the lighter occurrences; some
the terrors of distress, and some the gaieties of prosperity.
Thus rose the two modes of imitation, known by the
names of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tragedy</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">comedy</span></span>, compositions intended to
promote different ends by contrary means, and considered
as so little allied, that I do not recollect among
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Greeks or Romans a single writer who attempted
both.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shakespeare has united the powers of exciting laughter
and sorrow not only in one mind, but in one composition.
Almost all his plays are divided between
serious and ludicrous characters, and, in the successive
evolutions of the design, sometimes produce seriousness
and sorrow, and sometimes levity and laughter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That this is a practice contrary to the rules of criticism
will be readily allowed; but there is always an appeal
open from criticism to nature. The end of writing is
to instruct; the end of poetry is to instruct by
pleasing. That the mingled drama may convey
all the instruction of tragedy or comedy cannot be
denied, because it includes both in its alternations of
exhibition, and approaches nearer than either to the
appearance of life, by shewing how great machinations
and slender designs may promote or obviate one
another, and the high and the low co-operate in the
general system by unavoidable concatenation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is objected that by this change of scenes the
passions are interrupted in their progression, and that
the principal event, being not advanced by a due
gradation of preparatory incidents, wants at last the
power to move, which constitutes the perfection of
dramatick poetry. This reasoning is so specious, that
it is received as true even by those who in daily experience
feel it to be false. The interchanges of
mingled scenes seldom fail to produce the intended
vicissitudes of passion. Fiction cannot move so much,
but that the attention may be easily transferred; and
though it must be allowed that pleasing melancholy be
sometimes interrupted by unwelcome levity, yet let it
be considered likewise, that melancholy is often not
pleasing, and that the disturbance of one man may be
the relief of another; that different auditors have
different habitudes; and that, upon the whole, all
pleasure consists in variety.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The players, who in their edition divided our author's
works into comedies, histories, and tragedies, seem not
to have distinguished the three kinds, by any very
exact or definite ideas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An action which ended happily to the principal
persons, however serious or distressful through its
intermediate incidents, in their opinion constituted a
comedy. This idea of a comedy continued long
amongst us, and plays were written, which, by changing
the catastrophe, were tragedies to-day, and comedies
to-morrow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tragedy was not in those times a poem of more
general dignity or elevation than comedy; it required
only a calamitous conclusion, with which the common
criticism of that age was satisfied, whatever lighter
pleasure it afforded in its progress.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
History was a series of actions, with no other than
chronological succession, independent on each other,
and without any tendency to introduce and regulate
the conclusion. It is not always very nicely distinguished
from tragedy. There is not much nearer approach to
unity of action in the tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span></span>,
than in the history of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard the Second</span></span>. But a
history might be continued through many plays; as
it had no plan, it had no limits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Through all these denominations of the drama,
Shakespeare's mode of composition is the same; an interchange
of seriousness and merriment, by which the
mind is softened at one time, and exhilarated at another.
But whatever be his purpose, whether to gladden or
depress, or to conduct the story, without vehemence
or emotion, through tracts of easy and familiar dialogue,
he never fails to attain his purpose; as he commands
us, we laugh or mourn, or sit silent with quiet expectation,
in tranquillity without indifference.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Shakespeare's plan is understood, most of the
criticisms of Rhymer and Voltaire vanish away. The play
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> is opened, without impropriety, by two centinels;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Iago bellows at Brabantio's window, without injury to the
scheme of the play, though in terms which a modern
audience would not easily endure; the character of Polonius
is seasonable and useful, and the Grave-diggers
themselves may be heard with applause.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shakespeare engaged in dramatick poetry with the
world open before him; the rules of the ancients were
yet known to few; the publick judgment was unformed;
he had no example of such fame as might force him upon
imitation, nor criticks of such authority as might restrain
his extravagance: he therefore indulged his natural disposition,
and his disposition, as Rhymer has remarked, led
him to comedy. In tragedy he often writes with great
appearance of toil and study, what is written at last with
little felicity; but in his comick scenes, he seems to
produce without labour, what no labour can improve.
In tragedy he is always struggling after some occasion
to be comick, but in comedy he seems to repose, or to
luxuriate, as in a mode of thinking congenial to his nature.
In his tragick scenes there is always something wanting,
but his comedy often surpasses expectation or desire.
His comedy pleases by the thoughts and the language,
and his tragedy for the greater part by incident and
action. His tragedy seems to be skill, his comedy to
be instinct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The force of his comick scenes has suffered little
diminution from the changes made by a century and
a half, in manners or in words. As his personages act
upon principles arising from genuine passion, very little
modified by particular forms, their pleasures and vexations
are communicable to all times and to all places; they are
natural, and therefore durable; the adventitious peculiarities
of personal habits are only superficial dies, bright and
pleasing for a little while, yet soon fading to a dim tinct,
without any remains of former lustre; but the discriminations
of true passion are the colours of nature; they
pervade the whole mass, and can only perish with the
body that exhibits them. The accidental compositions of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heterogeneous modes are dissolved by the chance which
combined them; but the uniform simplicity of primitive
qualities neither admits increase, nor suffers decay. The
sand heaped by one flood is scattered by another, but the
rock always continues in its place. The stream of time,
which is continually washing the dissoluble fabricks of
other poets, passes without injury by the adamant of
Shakespeare.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If there be, what I believe there is, in every nation, a
stile which never becomes obsolete, a certain mode of
phraseology so consonant and congenial to the analogy
and principles of its respective language, as to remain
settled and unaltered; this stile is probably to be sought
in the common intercourse of life, among those who
speak only to be understood, without ambition of elegance.
The polite are always catching modish innovations, and
the learned depart from established forms of speech, in
hope of finding or making better; those who wish for
distinction forsake the vulgar, when the vulgar is right;
but there is a conversation above grossness and below
refinement, where propriety resides, and where this poet
seems to have gathered his comick dialogue. He is therefore
more agreeable to the ears of the present age than
any other author equally remote, and among his other
excellencies deserves to be studied as one of the original
masters of our language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These observations are to be considered not as unexceptionably
constant, but as containing general and
predominant truth. Shakespeare's familiar dialogue is
affirmed to be smooth and clear, yet not wholly without
ruggedness or difficulty; as a country may be eminently
fruitful, though it has spots unfit for cultivation: his
characters are praised as natural, though their sentiments
are sometimes forced, and their actions improbable; as
the earth upon the whole is spherical, though its surface is
varied with protuberances and cavities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shakespeare with his excellencies has likewise faults,
and faults sufficient to obscure and overwhelm any other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
merit. I shall shew them in the proportion in which
they appear to me, without envious malignity or superstitious
veneration. No question can be more innocently
discussed than a dead poet's pretensions to renown; and
little regard is due to that bigotry which sets candour
higher than truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His first defect is that to which may be imputed most
of the evil in books or in men. He sacrifices virtue
to convenience, and is so much more careful to please
than to instruct, that he seems to write without any moral
purpose. From his writings indeed a system of social
duty may be selected, for he that thinks reasonably must
think morally; but his precepts and axioms drop casually
from him; he makes no just distribution of good or evil,
nor is always careful to shew in the virtuous a disapprobation
of the wicked; he carries his persons indifferently
through right and wrong, and at the close dismisses them
without further care, and leaves their examples to operate
by chance. This fault the barbarity of his age cannot
extenuate; for it is always a writer's duty to make the
world better, and justice is a virtue independent on time
or place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The plots are often so loosely formed, that a very slight
consideration may improve them, and so carelessly pursued,
that he seems not always fully to comprehend his own
design. He omits opportunities of instructing or delighting,
which the train of his story seems to force upon him,
and apparently rejects those exhibitions which would be
more affecting, for the sake of those which are more easy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be observed that in many of his plays the latter
part is evidently neglected. When he found himself near
the end of his work, and in view of his reward, he
shortened the labour to snatch the profit. He therefore
remits his efforts where he should most vigorously exert
them, and his catastrophe is improbably produced or
imperfectly represented.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He had no regard to distinction of time or place, but
gives to one age or nation, without scruple, the customs,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
institutions, and opinions of another, at the expence not
only of likelihood, but of possibility. These faults Pope
has endeavoured, with more zeal than judgment, to transfer
to his imagined interpolators. We need not wonder
to find Hector quoting Aristotle, when we see the loves
of Theseus and Hippolyta combined with the Gothick
mythology of fairies. Shakespeare, indeed, was not the
only violator of chronology, for in the same age Sidney,
who wanted not the advantages of learning, has, in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arcadia</span></span>, confounded the pastoral with the feudal times,
the days of innocence, quiet, and security, with those of
turbulence, violence, and adventure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In his comick scenes he is seldom very successful,
when he engages his characters in reciprocations of smartness
and contests of sarcasm; their jests are commonly
gross, and their pleasantry licentious; neither his gentlemen
nor his ladies have much delicacy, nor are sufficiently
distinguished from his clowns by any appearance of refined
manners. Whether he represented the real conversation
of his time is not easy to determine; the reign of Elizabeth
is commonly supposed to have been a time of
stateliness, formality, and reserve, yet perhaps the relaxations
of that severity were not very elegant. There must,
however, have been always some modes of gaiety preferable
to others, and a writer ought to chuse the best.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In tragedy his performance seems constantly to be
worse, as his labour is more. The effusions of passion,
which exigence forces out, are for the most part striking
and energetick; but whenever he solicits his invention, or
strains his faculties, the offspring of his throes is tumour,
meanness, tediousness, and obscurity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In narration he affects a disproportionate pomp of
diction and a wearisome train of circumlocution, and tells
the incident imperfectly in many words, which might
have been more plainly delivered in few. Narration in
dramatick poetry is naturally tedious, as it is unanimated
and inactive, and obstructs the progress of the action; it
should therefore always be rapid, and enlivened by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
frequent interruption. Shakespeare found it an encumbrance,
and instead of lightening it by brevity, endeavoured
to recommend it by dignity and splendor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His declamations or set speeches are commonly cold
and weak, for his power was the power of nature; when
he endeavoured, like other tragick writers, to catch
opportunities of amplification, and instead of inquiring
what the occasion demanded, to shew how much his stores
of knowledge could supply, he seldom escapes without the
pity or resentment of his reader.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is incident to him to be now and then entangled with
an unwieldy sentiment, which he cannot well express, and
will not reject; he struggles with it a while, and if it
continues stubborn, comprises it in words such as occur,
and leaves it to be disentangled and evolved by those who
have more leisure to bestow upon it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not that always where the language is intricate the
thought is subtle, or the image always great where the
line is bulky; the equality of words to things is very
often neglected, and trivial sentiments and vulgar ideas
disappoint the attention, to which they are recommended
by sonorous epithets and swelling figures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the admirers of this great poet have most reason
to complain when he approaches nearest to his highest
excellence, and seems fully resolved to sink them in dejection,
and mollify them with tender emotions by the fall
of greatness, the danger of innocence, or the crosses of
love. What he does best, he soon ceases to do. He is
not long soft and pathetick without some idle conceit, or
contemptible equivocation. He no sooner begins to
move, than he counteracts himself; and terror and pity,
as they are rising in the mind, are checked and blasted
by sudden frigidity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A quibble is to Shakespeare what luminous vapours are
to the traveller: he follows it at all adventures; it is sure
to lead him out of his way, and sure to engulf him in
the mire. It has some malignant power over his mind,
and its fascinations are irresistible. Whatever be the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dignity or profundity of his disquisition, whether he be
enlarging knowledge or exalting affection, whether he be
amusing attention with incidents, or enchaining it in suspense,
let but a quibble spring up before him, and he
leaves his work unfinished. A quibble is the golden
apple for which he will always turn aside from his career,
or stoop from his elevation. A quibble, poor and barren
as it is, gave him such delight, that he was content to
purchase it by the sacrifice of reason, propriety, and truth.
A quibble was to him the fatal Cleopatra for which he
lost the world, and was content to lose it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be thought strange, that, in enumerating the
defects of this writer, I have not yet mentioned his
neglect of the unities; his violation of those laws which
have been instituted and established by the joint authority
of poets and of criticks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For his other deviations from the art of writing, I
resign him to critical justice, without making any other
demand in his favour, than that which must be indulged
to all human excellence; that his virtues be rated with
his failings: but, from the censure which this irregularity
may bring upon him, I shall, with due reverence to that
learning which I must oppose, adventure to try how I can
defend him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His histories, being neither tragedies nor comedies, are
not subject to any of their laws; nothing more is necessary
to all the praise which they expect, than that the
changes of action be so prepared as to be understood,
that the incidents be various and affecting, and the
characters consistent, natural, and distinct. No other
unity is intended, and therefore none is to be sought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In his other works he has well enough preserved the
unity of action. He has not, indeed, an intrigue regularly
perplexed and regularly unravelled; he does not endeavour
to hide his design only to discover it, for this is
seldom the order of real events, and Shakespeare is the
poet of nature: but his plan has commonly what Aristotle
requires, a beginning, a middle, and an end; one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
event is concatenated with another, and the conclusion
follows by easy consequence. There are perhaps some
incidents that might be spared, as in other poets there
is much talk that only fills up time upon the stage;
but the general system makes gradual advances, and the
end of the play is the end of expectation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the unities of time and place he has shewn no
regard; and perhaps a nearer view of the principles on
which they stand will diminish their value, and withdraw
from them the veneration which, from the time
of Corneille, they have very generally received, by discovering
that they have given more trouble to the poet,
than pleasure to the auditor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The necessity of observing the unities of time and
place arises from the supposed necessity of making the
drama credible. The criticks hold it impossible that an
action of months or years can be possibly believed to
pass in three hours; or that the spectator can suppose
himself to sit in the theatre, while ambassadors go and
return between distant kings, while armies are levied and
towns besieged, while an exile wanders and returns, or
till he whom they saw courting his mistress, shall lament
the untimely fall of his son. The mind revolts from
evident falsehood, and fiction loses its force when it
departs from the resemblance of reality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the narrow limitation of time necessarily arises
the contraction of place. The spectator, who knows
that he saw the first act at Alexandria, cannot suppose
that he sees the next at Rome, at a distance to which
not the dragons of Medea could, in so short a time,
have transported him; he knows with certainty that he
has not changed his place; and he knows that place
cannot change itself; that what was a house cannot
become a plain; that what was Thebes can never be
Persepolis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such is the triumphant language with which a critick
exults over the misery of an irregular poet, and exults
commonly without resistance or reply. It is time therefore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to tell him, by the authority of Shakespeare, that he
assumes, as an unquestionable principle, a position, which,
while his breath is forming it into words, his understanding
pronounces to be false. It is false that any
representation is mistaken for reality; that any dramatick
fable in its materiality was ever credible, or, for a single
moment, was ever credited.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The objection arising from the impossibility of passing
the first hour at Alexandria, and the next at Rome,
supposes that when the play opens the spectator really
imagines himself at Alexandria, and believes that his walk
to the theatre has been a voyage to Egypt, and that he
lives in the days of Antony and Cleopatra. Surely he
that imagines this may imagine more. He that can take
the stage at one time for the palace of the Ptolemies, may
take it in half an hour for the promontory of Actium.
Delusion, if delusion be admitted, has no certain limitation;
if the spectator can be once persuaded that his old
acquaintance are Alexander and Cæsar, that a room illuminated
with candles is the plain of Pharsalia, or the
bank of Granicus, he is in a state of elevation above the
reach of reason, or of truth, and from the heights of
empyrean poetry may despise the circumscriptions of
terrestrial nature. There is no reason why a mind thus
wandering in ecstasy should count the clock, or why an
hour should not be a century in that calenture of the
brains that can make the stage a field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The truth is that the spectators are always in their
senses, and know, from the first act to the last, that the
stage is only a stage, and that the players are only players.
They come to hear a certain number of lines recited with
just gesture and elegant modulation. The lines relate to
some action, and an action must be in some place; but the
different actions that complete a story may be in places
very remote from each other; and where is the absurdity
of allowing that space to represent first Athens, and then
Sicily, which was always known to be neither Sicily nor
Athens, but a modern theatre.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By supposition, as place is introduced, time may be
extended; the time required by the fable elapses for the
most part between the acts; for, of so much of the action
as is represented, the real and poetical duration is the
same. If, in the first act, preparations for war against
Mithridates are represented to be made in Rome, the event
of the war may, without absurdity, be represented, in the
catastrophe, as happening in Pontus; we know that there
is neither war, nor preparation for war; we know that we
are neither in Rome nor Pontus; that neither Mithridates
nor Lucullus are before us. The drama exhibits successive
imitations of successive actions, and why may not the
second imitation represent an action that happened years
after the first; if it be so connected with it, that nothing
but time can be supposed to intervene. Time is, of all
modes of existence, most obsequious to the imagination;
a lapse of years is as easily conceived as a passage of
hours. In contemplation we easily contract the time of
real actions, and therefore willingly permit it to be contracted
when we only see their imitation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be asked how the drama moves, if it is not
credited. It is credited with all the credit due to a drama.
It is credited, whenever it moves, as a just picture of a
real original; as representing to the auditor what he
would himself feel, if he were to do or suffer what is there
feigned to be suffered or to be done. The reflection that
strikes the heart is not that the evils before us are real
evils, but that they are evils to which we ourselves may be
exposed. If there be any fallacy, it is not that we fancy
the players, but that we fancy ourselves unhappy for a
moment; but we rather lament the possibility than
suppose the presence of misery, as a mother weeps over
her babe, when she remembers that death may take it from
her. The delight of tragedy proceeds from our consciousness
of fiction; if we thought murders and treasons
real, they would please no more.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Imitations produce pain or pleasure, not because they
are mistaken for realities, but because they bring realities
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to mind. When the imagination is recreated by a painted
landscape, the trees are not supposed capable to give us
shade, or the fountains coolness; but we consider how
we should be pleased with such fountains playing beside
us, and such woods waving over us. We are agitated in
reading the history of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry the Fifth</span></span>, yet no man takes
his book for the field of Agincourt. A dramatick exhibition
is a book recited with concomitants that increase
or diminish its effect. Familiar comedy is often more
powerful in the theatre, than on the page; imperial
tragedy is always less. The humour of Petruchio may be
heightened by grimace; but what voice or what gesture
can hope to add dignity or force to the soliloquy of Cato?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A play read affects the mind like a play acted. It
is therefore evident that the action is not supposed to be
real; and it follows that between the acts a longer or
shorter time may be allowed to pass, and that no more
account of space or duration is to be taken by the auditor
of a drama, than by the reader of a narrative, before
whom may pass in an hour the life of a hero, or the
revolutions of an empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether Shakespeare knew the unities, and rejected
them by design, or deviated from them by happy
ignorance, it is, I think, impossible to decide, and useless
to enquire. We may reasonably suppose that, when he
rose to notice, he did not want the counsels and admonitions
of scholars and criticks, and that he at last deliberately
persisted in a practice, which he might have
begun by chance. As nothing is essential to the fable
but unity of action, and as the unities of time and place
arise evidently from false assumptions, and, by circumscribing
the extent of the drama, lessen its variety, I
cannot think it much to be lamented that they were not
known by him, or not observed: nor, if such another
poet could arise, should I very vehemently reproach
him, that his first act passed at Venice, and his next in
Cyprus. Such violations of rules merely positive become
the comprehensive genius of Shakespeare, and such censures
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are suitable to the minute and slender criticism
of Voltaire:

Yet when I speak thus slightly of dramatick rules, I
cannot but recollect how much wit and learning may
be produced against me; before such authorities I am
afraid to stand, not that I think the present question one
of those that are to be decided by mere authority, but
because it is to be suspected that these precepts have not
been so easily received but for better reasons than I
have yet been able to find. The result of my enquiries, in
which it would be ludicrous to boast of impartiality, is
that the unities of time and place are not essential to
a just drama, that though they may sometimes conduce to
pleasure, they are always to be sacrificed to the nobler
beauties of variety and instruction; and that a play,
written with nice observation of critical rules, is to be
contemplated as an elaborate curiosity, as the product of
superfluous and ostentatious art, by which is shewn, rather
what is possible, than what is necessary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He that, without diminution of any other excellence,
shall preserve all the unities unbroken, deserves the like
applause with the architect who shall display all the
orders of architecture in a citadel, without any deduction
from its strength; but the principal beauty of a citadel
is to exclude the enemy; and the greatest graces of a
play are to copy nature, and instruct life.

Perhaps what I have here not dogmatically but
deliberately written, may recall the principles of the
drama to a new examination. I am almost frighted
at my own temerity; and when I estimate the fame
and the strength of those that maintain the contrary
opinion, am ready to sink down in reverential silence;
as Æneas withdrew from the defence of Troy, when he
saw Neptune shaking the wall, and Juno heading the
besiegers.

Those whom my arguments cannot persuade to give

easily, if they consider the condition of his life, make
some allowance for his ignorance.

Every man's performances, to be rightly estimated,
must be compared with the state of the age in which he
lived, and with his own particular opportunities; and
though to a reader a book be not worse or better for
the circumstances of the author, yet as there is always a
silent reference of human works to human abilities, and as
the enquiry, how far man may extend his designs, or how
high he may rate his native force, is of far greater dignity
than in what rank we shall place any particular performance,
curiosity is always busy to discover the instruments,
as well as to survey the workmanship, to know how much
is to be ascribed to original powers, and how much to
casual and adventitious help. The palaces of Peru or
Mexico were certainly mean and incommodious habitations,
if compared to the houses of European monarchs;
yet who could forbear to view them with astonishment,
who remembered that they were built without the use
of iron?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The English nation, in the time of Shakespeare, was
yet struggling to emerge from barbarity. The philology
of Italy had been transplanted hither in the reign of
Henry the Eighth; and the learned languages had been
successfully cultivated by Lilly, Linacre, and More; by
Pole, Cheke, and Gardiner; and afterwards by Smith,
Clerk, Haddon, and Ascham. Greek was now taught
to boys in the principal schools; and those who united
elegance with learning, read, with great diligence, the
Italian and Spanish poets. But literature was yet confined
to professed scholars, or to men and women of high
rank. The publick was gross and dark; and to be able
to read and write, was an accomplishment still valued for
its rarity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nations, like individuals, have their infancy. A
people newly awakened to literary curiosity, being yet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unacquainted with the true state of things, knows not
how to judge of that which is proposed as its resemblance.
Whatever is remote from common appearances
is always welcome to vulgar, as to childish credulity; and
of a country unenlightened by learning, the whole people
is the vulgar. The study of those who then aspired to
plebeian learning was then laid out upon adventures,
giants, dragons, and enchantments. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Death of
Arthur</span></span> was the favourite volume.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mind which has feasted on the luxurious wonders
of fiction, has no taste of the insipidity of truth. A play
which imitated only the common occurrences of the
world, would, upon the admirers of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Palmerin</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guy
of Warwick</span></span>, have made little impression; he that wrote
for such an audience was under the necessity of looking
round for strange events and fabulous transactions, and
that incredibility, by which maturer knowledge is
offended, was the chief recommendation of writings, to
unskilful curiosity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our author's plots are generally borrowed from novels;
and it is reasonable to suppose that he chose the most
popular, such as were read by many, and related by
more; for his audience could not have followed him
through the intricacies of the drama, had they not held
the thread of the story in their hands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The stories which we now find only in remoter authors,
were in his time accessible and familiar. The fable
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As you like it</span></span>, which is supposed to be copied from
Chaucer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gamelyn</span></span>, was a little pamphlet of those times;
and old Mr. Cibber remembered the tale of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> in
plain English prose, which the criticks have now to
seek in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saxo Grammaticus</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His English histories he took from English chronicles
and English ballads; and as the ancient writers were
made known to his countrymen by versions, they supplied
him with new subjects; he dilated some of Plutarch's
lives into plays, when they had been translated by North.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His plots, whether historical or fabulous, are always
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
crouded with incidents, by which the attention of a
rude people was more easily caught than by sentiment
or argumentation; and such is the power of the marvellous,
even over those who despise it, that every man
finds his mind more strongly seized by the tragedies of
Shakespeare than of any other writer; others please
us by particular speeches, but he always makes us anxious
for the event, and has perhaps excelled all but Homer
in securing the first purpose of a writer, by exciting
restless and unquenchable curiosity, and compelling him
that reads his work to read it through.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The shows and bustle with which his plays abound
have the same original. As knowledge advances, pleasure
passes from the eye to the ear, but returns, as it declines,
from the ear to the eye. Those to whom our author's
labours were exhibited had more skill in pomps or processions
than in poetical language, and perhaps wanted
some visible and discriminated events, as comments on
the dialogue. He knew how he should most please;
and whether his practice is more agreeable to nature,
or whether his example has prejudiced the nation, we
still find that on our stage something must be done as
well as said, and inactive declamation is very coldly
heard, however musical or elegant, passionate or sublime.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Voltaire expresses his wonder, that our author's
extravagancies are endured by a nation which has seen
the tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cato</span></span>. Let him be answered, that Addison
speaks the language of poets, and Shakespeare, of
men. We find in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cato</span></span> innumerable beauties which
enamour us of its author, but we see nothing that
acquaints us with human sentiments or human actions;
we place it with the fairest and the noblest progeny
which judgment propagates by conjunction with learning;
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Othello</span></span> is the vigorous and vivacious offspring of
observation impregnated by genius. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cato</span></span> affords a
splendid exhibition of artificial and fictitious manners,
and delivers just and noble sentiments, in diction easy,
elevated, and harmonious, but its hopes and fears communicate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no vibration to the heart; the composition
refers us only to the writer; we pronounce the name
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cato</span></span>, but we think on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Addison</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The work of a correct and regular writer is a garden
accurately formed and diligently planted, varied with
shades, and scented with flowers; the composition of
Shakespeare is a forest, in which oaks extend their
branches, and pines tower in the air, interspersed sometimes
with weeds and brambles, and sometimes giving
shelter to myrtles and to roses; filling the eye with
awful pomp, and gratifying the mind with endless
diversity. Other poets display cabinets of precious
rarities, minutely finished, wrought into shape, and
polished into brightness. Shakespeare opens a mine
which contains gold and diamonds in unexhaustible
plenty, though clouded by incrustations, debased by
impurities, and mingled with a mass of meaner minerals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been much disputed, whether Shakespeare owed
his excellence to his own native force, or whether he had
the common helps of scholastick education, the precepts
of critical science, and the examples of ancient authors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There has always prevailed a tradition, that Shakespeare
wanted learning, that he had no regular education, nor
much skill in the dead languages. Jonson, his friend,
affirms that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he had small Latin, and less Greek</span></span>; who,
besides that he had no imaginable temptation to falsehood,
wrote at a time when the character and acquisitions
of Shakespeare were known to multitudes. His evidence
ought therefore to decide the controversy, unless some
testimony of equal force could be opposed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some have imagined that they have discovered deep
learning in many imitations of old writers; but the examples
which I have known urged, were drawn from
books translated in his time; or were such easy coincidences
of thought, as will happen to all who consider the same
subjects; or such remarks on life or axioms of morality
as float in conversation, and are transmitted through the
world in proverbial sentences.

I have found it remarked that, in this important
sentence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Go before, I'll follow</span></span>, we read a translation of,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I prae, sequar</span></span>. I have been told that when Caliban,
after a pleasing dream, says, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I cry'd to sleep again</span></span>, the
author imitates Anacreon, who had, like every other
man, the same wish on the same occasion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are a few passages which may pass for imitations,
but so few, that the exception only confirms the
rule; he obtained them from accidental quotations, or
by oral communication, and as he used what he had,
would have used more if he had obtained it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedy of Errors</span></span> is confessedly taken from the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menæchmi</span></span> of Plautus; from the only play of Plautus
which was then in English. What can be more probable,
than that he who copied that, would have copied more,
but that those which were not translated were inaccessible?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether he knew the modern languages is uncertain.
That his plays have some French scenes proves but
little; he might easily procure them to be written, and
probably, even though he had known the language in
the common degree, he could not have written it without
assistance. In the story of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romeo and Juliet</span></span> he is
observed to have followed the English translation, where
it deviates from the Italian; but this on the other part
proves nothing against his knowledge of the original.
He was to copy, not what he knew himself, but what
was known to his audience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is most likely that he had learned Latin sufficiently
to make him acquainted with construction, but that he
never advanced to an easy perusal of the Roman authors.
Concerning his skill in modern languages, I can find no
sufficient ground of determination; but as no imitations
of French or Italian authors have been discovered, though
the Italian poetry was then in high esteem, I am inclined
to believe that he read little more than English, and
chose for his fables only such tales as he found translated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That much knowledge is scattered over his works is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
very justly observed by Pope, but it is often such
knowledge as books did not supply. He that will understand
Shakespeare, must not be content to study him in
the closet, he must look for his meaning sometimes
among the sports of the field, and sometimes among the
manufactures of the shop.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is however proof enough that he was a very
diligent reader, nor was our language then so indigent
of books, but that he might very liberally indulge his
curiosity without excursion into foreign literature. Many
of the Roman authors were translated, and some of the
Greek; the Reformation had filled the kingdom with
theological learning; most of the topicks of human
disquisition had found English writers; and poetry had
been cultivated, not only with diligence, but success.
This was a stock of knowledge sufficient for a mind so
capable of appropriating and improving it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the greater part of his excellence was the product
of his own genius. He found the English stage in a
state of the utmost rudeness; no essays either in tragedy
or comedy had appeared, from which it could be discovered
to what degree of delight either one or other might be
carried. Neither character nor dialogue were yet understood.
Shakespeare may be truly said to have introduced
them both amongst us, and in some of his happier scenes
to have carried them both to the utmost height.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By what gradations of improvement he proceeded, is
not easily known; for the chronology of his works is
yet unsettled. Rowe is of opinion that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">perhaps we are
not to look for his beginning, like those of other writers, in
his least perfect works; art had so little, and nature so large
a share in what he did, that for ought I know, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">says he</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">,
the performances of his youth, as they were the most vigorous,
were the best.</span></span> But the power of nature is only the power
of using to any certain purpose the materials which
diligence procures, or opportunity supplies. Nature gives
no man knowledge, and when images are collected by
study and experience, can only assist in combining or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
applying them. Shakespeare, however favoured by
nature, could impart only what he had learned; and
as he must increase his ideas, like other mortals, by
gradual acquisition, he, like them, grew wiser as he grew
older, could display life better, as he knew it more, and
instruct with more efficacy, as he was himself more amply
instructed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a vigilance of observation and accuracy of
distinction which books and precepts cannot confer;
from this almost all original and native excellence proceeds.
Shakespeare must have looked upon mankind
with perspicacity, in the highest degree curious and
attentive. Other writers borrow their characters from
preceding writers, and diversify them only by the
accidental appendages of present manners; the dress is
a little varied, but the body is the same. Our author
had both matter and form to provide; for, except the
characters of Chaucer, to whom I think he is not much
indebted, there were no writers in English, and perhaps
not many in other modern languages, which shewed life
in its native colours.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The contest about the original benevolence or malignity
of man had not yet commenced. Speculation had not yet
attempted to analyse the mind, to trace the passions to
their sources, to unfold the seminal principles of vice and
virtue, or sound the depths of the heart for the motives of
action. All those enquiries, which from that time that
human nature became the fashionable study have been
made sometimes with nice discernment, but often with idle
subtilty, were yet unattempted. The tales with which
the infancy of learning was satisfied, exhibited only the
superficial appearances of action, related the events, but
omitted the causes, and were formed for such as delighted
in wonders rather than in truth. Mankind was not then
to be studied in the closet; he that would know the
world, was under the necessity of gleaning his own
remarks, by mingling as he could in its business and
amusements.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Boyle congratulated himself upon his high birth, because
it favoured his curiosity, by facilitating his access.
Shakespeare had no such advantage; he came to London
a needy adventurer, and lived for a time by very mean
employments. Many works of genius and learning have
been performed in states of life that appear very little
favourable to thought or to enquiry; so many, that he
who considers them is inclined to think that he sees enterprize
and perseverance predominating over all external
agency, and bidding help and hindrance vanish before
them. The genius of Shakespeare was not to be depressed
by the weight of poverty, nor limited by the narrow conversation
to which men in want are inevitably condemned;
the incumbrances of his fortune were shaken from his
mind, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as dew-drops from a lion's mane</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though he had so many difficulties to encounter, and
so little assistance to surmount them, he has been able
to obtain an exact knowledge of many modes of life, and
many casts of native dispositions; to vary them with
great multiplicity; to mark them by nice distinctions; and
to shew them in full view by proper combinations. In
this part of his performances he had none to imitate, but
has himself been imitated by all succeeding writers; and it
may be doubted, whether from all his successors more
maxims of theoretical knowledge, or more rules of
practical prudence, can be collected, than he alone has
given to his country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor was his attention confined to the actions of men;
he was an exact surveyor of the inanimate world; his
descriptions have always some peculiarities, gathered by
contemplating things as they really exist. It may be
observed that the oldest poets of many nations preserve
their reputation, and that the following generations of wit,
after a short celebrity, sink into oblivion. The first, whoever
they be, must take their sentiments and descriptions
immediately from knowledge; the resemblance is therefore
just, their descriptions are verified by every eye, and their
sentiments acknowledged by every breast. Those whom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their fame invites to the same studies, copy partly them,
and partly nature, till the books of one age gain such
authority, as to stand in the place of nature to another,
and imitation, always deviating a little, becomes at last
capricious and casual. Shakespeare, whether life or nature
be his subject, shews plainly that he has seen with his own
eyes; he gives the image which he receives, not weakened
or distorted by the intervention of any other mind; the
ignorant feel his representations to be just, and the learned
see that they are complete.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps it would not be easy to find any author, except
Homer, who invented so much as Shakespeare, who so
much advanced the studies which he cultivated, or effused
so much novelty upon his age or country. The form,
the characters, the language, and the shows of the English
drama are his. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He seems,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">says Dennis</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, to have been the
very original of our English tragical harmony, that is, the
harmony of blank verse, diversified often by dissyllable and
trissyllable terminations. For the diversity distinguishes it from
heroick harmony, and by bringing it nearer to common use
makes it more proper to gain attention, and more fit for action
and dialogue. Such verse we make when we are writing
prose; we make such verse in common conversation.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know not whether this praise is rigorously just. The
dissyllable termination, which the critick rightly appropriates
to the drama, is to be found, though, I think, not in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gorboduc</span></span>, which is confessedly before our author, yet in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hieronymo</span></span>, of which the date is not certain, but which
there is reason to believe at least as old as his earliest
plays. This however is certain, that he is the first who
taught either tragedy or comedy to please, there being no
theatrical piece of any older writer, of which the name is
known, except to antiquaries and collectors of books,
which are sought because they are scarce, and would not
have been scarce, had they been much esteemed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To him we must ascribe the praise, unless Spenser may
divide it with him, of having first discovered to how much
smoothness and harmony the English language could be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
softened. He has speeches, perhaps sometimes scenes,
which have all the delicacy of Rowe, without his effeminacy.
He endeavours indeed commonly to strike by the force and
vigour of his dialogue, but he never executes his purpose
better, than when he tries to sooth by softness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet it must be at last confessed that as we owe every
thing to him, he owes something to us; that, if much of
his praise is paid by perception and judgment, much is
likewise given by custom and veneration. We fix our
eyes upon his graces, and turn them from his deformities,
and endure in him what we should in another loath or
despise. If we endured without praising, respect for the
father of our drama might excuse us; but I have seen, in
the book of some modern critick, a collection of anomalies
which shew that he has corrupted language by every mode
of depravation, but which his admirer has accumulated as
a monument of honour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He has scenes of undoubted and perpetual excellence,
but perhaps not one play, which, if it were now exhibited
as the work of a contemporary writer, would be heard to
the conclusion. I am indeed far from thinking that his
works were wrought to his own ideas of perfection; when
they were such as would satisfy the audience, they
satisfied the writer. It is seldom that authors, though
more studious of fame than Shakespeare, rise much above
the standard of their own age; to add a little to what
is best will always be sufficient for present praise, and
those who find themselves exalted into fame, are willing
to credit their encomiasts, and to spare the labour of
contending with themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It does not appear that Shakespeare thought his works
worthy of posterity, that he levied any ideal tribute upon
future times, or had any further prospect than of present
popularity and present profit. When his plays had been
acted, his hope was at an end; he solicited no addition of
honour from the reader. He therefore made no scruple
to repeat the same jests in many dialogues, or to entangle
different plots by the same knot of perplexity, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may be at least forgiven him, by those who recollect,
that of Congreve's four comedies two are concluded by a
marriage in a mask, by a deception which perhaps never
happened, and which, whether likely or not, he did not
invent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So careless was this great poet of future fame, that,
though he retired to ease and plenty, while he was yet
little <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">declined into the vale of years</span></span>, before he could be
disgusted with fatigue, or disabled by infirmity, he made
no collection of his works, nor desired to rescue those
that had been already published from the depravations
that obscured them, or secure to the rest a better destiny,
by giving them to the world in their genuine state.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the plays which bear the name of Shakespeare in the
late editions, the greater part were not published till about
seven years after his death, and the few which appeared
in his life are apparently thrust into the world without
the care of the author, and therefore probably without
his knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of all the publishers, clandestine or professed, their
negligence and unskilfulness has by the late revisers been
sufficiently shewn. The faults of all are indeed numerous
and gross, and have not only corrupted many passages
perhaps beyond recovery, but have brought others into
suspicion, which are only obscured by obsolete phraseology,
or by the writer's unskilfulness and affectation.
To alter is more easy than to explain, and temerity is
a more common quality than diligence. Those who saw
that they must employ conjecture to a certain degree,
were willing to indulge it a little further. Had the
author published his own works, we should have sat
quietly down to disentangle his intricacies, and clear his
obscurities; but now we tear what we cannot loose,
and eject what we happen not to understand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The faults are more than could have happened without
the concurrence of many causes. The stile of Shakespeare
was in itself ungrammatical, perplexed, and
obscure; his works were transcribed for the players by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those who may be supposed to have seldom understood
them; they were transmitted by copiers equally unskilful,
who still multiplied errors; they were perhaps sometimes
mutilated by the actors, for the sake of shortening the
speeches; and were at last printed without correction of
the press.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this state they remained, not, as Dr. Warburton
supposes, because they were unregarded, but because the
editor's art was not yet applied to modern languages, and
our ancestors were accustomed to so much negligence of
English printers, that they could very patiently endure it.
At last an edition was undertaken by Rowe; not because
a poet was to be published by a poet, for Rowe seems to
have thought very little on correction or explanation, but
that our author's works might appear like those of his
fraternity, with the appendages of a life and recommendatory
preface. Rowe has been clamorously blamed for not
performing what he did not undertake, and it is time that
justice be done him, by confessing that though he seems
to have had no thought of corruption beyond the printer's
errors, yet he has made many emendations, if they were
not made before, which his successors have received
without acknowledgment, and which, if they had produced
them, would have filled pages and pages with censures of
the stupidity by which the faults were committed, with
displays of the absurdities which they involved, with
ostentatious expositions of the new reading, and self-congratulations
on the happiness of discovering it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As of the other editors I have preserved the prefaces, I
have likewise borrowed the author's life from Rowe,
though not written with much elegance or spirit; it
relates however what is now to be known, and therefore
deserves to pass through all succeeding publications.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The nation had been for many years content enough
with Mr. Rowe's performance, when Mr. Pope made
them acquainted with the true state of Shakespeare's text,
shewed that it was extremely corrupt, and gave reason to
hope that there were means of reforming it. He collated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the old copies, which none had thought to examine
before, and restored many lines to their integrity; but,
by a very compendious criticism, he rejected whatever he
disliked, and thought more of amputation than of cure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know not why he is commended by Dr. Warburton
for distinguishing the genuine from the spurious plays.
In this choice he exerted no judgment of his own; the
plays which he received were given by Hemings and
Condel, the first editors; and those which he rejected,
though, according to the licentiousness of the press in
those times, they were printed during Shakespeare's life,
with his name, had been omitted by his friends, and were
never added to his works before the edition of 1664, from
which they were copied by the later printers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was a work which Pope seems to have thought
unworthy of his abilities, being not able to suppress his
contempt of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the dull duty of an editor</span></span>. He understood but
half his undertaking. The duty of a collator is indeed
dull, yet, like other tedious tasks, is very necessary; but
an emendatory critick would ill discharge his duty, without
qualities very different from dulness. In perusing a
corrupted piece, he must have before him all possibilities
of meaning, with all possibilities of expression. Such must
be his comprehension of thought, and such his copiousness
of language. Out of many readings possible, he must be
able to select that which best suits with the state, opinions,
and modes of language prevailing in every age, and with
his author's particular cast of thought, and turn of
expression. Such must be his knowledge, and such his
taste. Conjectural criticism demands more than humanity
possesses, and he that exercises it with most praise, has
very frequent need of indulgence. Let us now be told no
more of the dull duty of an editor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Confidence is the common consequence of success.
They whose excellence of any kind has been loudly celebrated,
are ready to conclude that their powers are
universal. Pope's edition fell below his own expectations,
and he was so much offended, when he was found to have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
left any thing for others to do, that he passed the latter
part of his life in a state of hostility with verbal criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have retained all his notes, that no fragment of
so great a writer may be lost; his preface, valuable alike
for elegance of composition and justness of remark, and
containing a general criticism on his author, so extensive
that little can be added, and so exact, that little can be
disputed, every editor has an interest to suppress, but that
every reader would demand its insertion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope was succeeded by Theobald, a man of narrow
comprehension and small acquisitions, with no native and
intrinsick splendor of genius, with little of the artificial
light of learning, but zealous for minute accuracy, and not
negligent in pursuing it. He collated the ancient copies,
and rectified many errors. A man so anxiously scrupulous
might have been expected to do more, but what little he
did was commonly right.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In his reports of copies and editions he is not to
be trusted without examination. He speaks sometimes
indefinitely of copies, when he has only one. In his
enumeration of editions, he mentions the two first folios
as of high, and the third folio as of middle authority; but
the truth is that the first is equivalent to all others, and
that the rest only deviate from it by the printer's negligence.
Whoever has any of the folios has all, excepting
those diversities which mere reiteration of editions will
produce. I collated them all at the beginning, but afterwards
used only the first.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of his notes I have generally retained those which he
retained himself in his second edition, except when they
were confuted by subsequent annotators, or were too
minute to merit preservation. I have sometimes adopted
his restoration of a comma, without inserting the panegyrick
in which he celebrated himself for his achievement.
The exuberant excrescence of his diction I have often
lopped, his triumphant exultations over Pope and Rowe I
have sometimes suppressed, and his contemptible ostentation
I have frequently concealed; but I have in some
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
places shewn him as he would have shewn himself, for
the reader's diversion, that the inflated emptiness of
some notes may justify or excuse the contraction of
the rest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theobald, thus weak and ignorant, thus mean and
faithless, thus petulant and ostentatious, by the good
luck of having Pope for his enemy, has escaped, and
escaped alone, with reputation, from this undertaking. So
willingly does the world support those who solicit favour,
against those who command reverence; and so easily is he
praised, whom no man can envy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our author fell then into the hands of Sir Thomas Hanmer,
the Oxford editor, a man, in my opinion, eminently
qualified by nature for such studies. He had, what is the
first requisite to emendatory criticism, that intuition by
which the poet's intention is immediately discovered, and
that dexterity of intellect which dispatches its work by
the easiest means. He had undoubtedly read much;
his acquaintance with customs, opinions, and traditions,
seems to have been large; and he is often learned without
shew. He seldom passes what he does not understand,
without an attempt to find or to make a meaning,
and sometimes hastily makes what a little more attention
would have found. He is solicitous to reduce to grammar
what he could not be sure that his author intended to be
grammatical. Shakespeare regarded more the series of
ideas, than of words; and his language, not being designed
for the reader's desk, was all that he desired it to be, if it
conveyed his meaning to the audience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hanmer's care of the metre has been too violently
censured. He found the measure reformed in so many
passages, by the silent labours of some editors, with the
silent acquiescence of the rest, that he thought himself
allowed to extend a little further the licence which had
already been carried so far without reprehension; and of
his corrections in general, it must be confessed that they
are often just, and made commonly with the least possible
violation of the text.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, by inserting his emendations, whether invented or
borrowed, into the page, without any notice of varying
copies, he has appropriated the labour of his predecessors,
and made his own edition of little authority. His confidence
indeed, both in himself and others, was too great;
he supposes all to be right that was done by Pope and
Theobald; he seems not to suspect a critick of fallibility,
and it was but reasonable that he should claim what he so
liberally granted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As he never writes without careful enquiry and diligent
consideration, I have received all his notes, and believe
that every reader will wish for more.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the last editor it is more difficult to speak. Respect
is due to high place, tenderness to living reputation, and
veneration to genius and learning; but he cannot be
justly offended at that liberty of which he has himself
so frequently given an example, nor very solicitous what
is thought of notes, which he ought never to have considered
as part of his serious employments, and which,
I suppose, since the ardour of composition is remitted,
he no longer numbers among his happy effusions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The original and predominant error of his commentary
is acquiescence in his first thoughts; that precipitation
which is produced by consciousness of quick discernment;
and that confidence which presumes to do, by surveying
the surface, what labour only can perform, by penetrating
the bottom. His notes exhibit sometimes perverse interpretations,
and sometimes improbable conjectures; he at
one time gives the author more profundity of meaning
than the sentence admits, and at another discovers
absurdities, where the sense is plain to every other
reader. But his emendations are likewise often happy
and just; and his interpretation of obscure passages
learned and sagacious.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of his notes, I have commonly rejected those against
which the general voice of the publick has exclaimed,
or which their own incongruity immediately condemns,
and which, I suppose, the author himself would desire to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be forgotten. Of the rest, to part I have given the
highest approbation, by inserting the offered reading in
the text; part I have left to the judgment of the reader,
as doubtful, though specious; and part I have censured
without reserve, but I am sure without bitterness of
malice, and, I hope, without wantonness of insult.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is no pleasure to me, in revising my volumes, to
observe how much paper is wasted in confutation. Whoever
considers the revolutions of learning, and the various
questions of greater or less importance, upon which wit
and reason have exercised their powers, must lament the
unsuccessfulness of enquiry, and the slow advances of
truth, when he reflects, that great part of the labour of
every writer is only the destruction of those that went
before him. The first care of the builder of a new
system, is to demolish the fabricks which are standing.
The chief desire of him that comments an author, is to
shew how much other commentators have corrupted and
obscured him. The opinions prevalent in one age, as
truths above the reach of controversy, are confuted and
rejected in another, and rise again to reception in remoter
times. Thus the human mind is kept in motion without
progress. Thus sometimes truth and error, and sometimes
contrarieties of error, take each other's place by
reciprocal invasion. The tide of seeming knowledge
which is poured over one generation, retires and leaves
another naked and barren; the sudden meteors of
intelligence, which for a while appear to shoot their
beams into the regions of obscurity, on a sudden withdraw
their lustre, and leave mortals again to grope their
way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These elevations and depressions of renown, and the
contradictions to which all improvers of knowledge must
for ever be exposed, since they are not escaped by the
highest and brightest of mankind, may surely be endured
with patience by criticks and annotators, who can rank
themselves but as the satellites of their authors. How
canst thou beg for life, says Homer's hero to his captive,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when thou knowest that thou art now to suffer only
what must another day be suffered by Achilles?

Dr. Warburton had a name sufficient to confer
celebrity on those who could exalt themselves into
antagonists, and his notes have raised a clamour too
loud to be distinct. His chief assailants are the authors
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The canons of criticism</span></span>,
and of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The revisal of Shakespeare's

attacks them with gloomy malignity, as if he were dragging
to justice an assassin or incendiary. The one stings like
a fly, sucks a little blood, takes a gay flutter, and returns
for more; the other bites like a viper, and would be glad
to leave inflammations and gangrene behind him. When
I think on one, with his confederates, I remember the
danger of Coriolanus, who was afraid that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">girls with spits,

Let me however do them justice. One is a wit, and
one a scholar. They have both shewn acuteness sufficient
in the discovery of faults, and have both advanced some
probable interpretations of obscure passages; but when
they aspire to conjecture and emendation, it appears how
falsely we all estimate our own abilities, and the little
which they have been able to perform might have taught
them more candour to the endeavours of others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before Dr. Warburton's edition, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Critical observations
on Shakespeare</span></span> had been published by Mr. Upton, a man
skilled in languages, and acquainted with books, but who
seems to have had no great vigour of genius or nicety of
taste. Many of his explanations are curious and useful,
but he likewise, though he professed to oppose the
licentious confidence of editors, and adhere to the old
copies, is unable to restrain the rage of emendation,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though his ardour is ill seconded by his skill. Every
cold empirick, when his heart is expanded by a successful
experiment, swells into a theorist, and the laborious
collator at some unlucky moment frolicks in conjecture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Critical, historical, and explanatory notes</span></span> have been likewise
published upon Shakespeare by Dr. Grey, whose
diligent perusal of the old English writers has enabled
him to make some useful observations. What he undertook
he has well enough performed, but as he neither
attempts judicial nor emendatory criticism, he employs
rather his memory than his sagacity. It were to be
wished that all would endeavour to imitate his modesty,
who have not been able to surpass his knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I can say with great sincerity of all my predecessors,
what I hope will hereafter be said of me, that not one has
left Shakespeare without improvement, nor is there one to
whom I have not been indebted for assistance and information.
Whatever I have taken from them, it was my
intention to refer to its original author, and it is certain,
that what I have not given to another, I believed when I
wrote it to be my own. In some perhaps I have been
anticipated; but if I am ever found to encroach upon
the remarks of any other commentator, I am willing that
the honour, be it more or less, should be transferred to
the first claimant, for his right, and his alone, stands above
dispute; the second can prove his pretensions only to
himself, nor can himself always distinguish invention,
with sufficient certainty, from recollection.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They have all been treated by me with candour, which
they have not been careful of observing to one another.
It is not easy to discover from what cause the acrimony of
a scholiast can naturally proceed. The subjects to be
discussed by him are of very small importance; they
involve neither property nor liberty; nor favour the
interest of sect or party. The various readings of copies,
and different interpretations of a passage, seem to be
questions that might exercise the wit, without engaging
the passions. But whether it be that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">small things make
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
mean men proud</span></span>, and vanity catches small occasions; or
that all contrariety of opinion, even in those that can
defend it no longer, makes proud men angry; there
is often found in commentaries a spontaneous strain of
invective and contempt, more eager and venomous than
is vented by the most furious controvertist in politicks
against those whom he is hired to defame.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the lightness of the matter may conduce to the
vehemence of the agency; when the truth to be investigated
is so near to inexistence, as to escape attention, its
bulk is to be enlarged by rage and exclamation: that to
which all would be indifferent in its original state, may
attract notice when the fate of a name is appended to it.
A commentator has indeed great temptations to supply by
turbulence what he wants of dignity, to beat his little gold
to a spacious surface, to work that to foam which no art
or diligence can exalt to spirit.

The explanations transcribed from others, if I do not
subjoin any other interpretation, I suppose commonly to
be right, at least I intend by acquiescence to confess that I
have nothing better to propose.

After the labours of all the editors, I found many
passages which appeared to me likely to obstruct the
greater number of readers, and thought it my duty to
facilitate their passage. It is impossible for an expositor
not to write too little for some, and too much for others.
He can only judge what is necessary by his own experience;
and how long soever he may deliberate, will at
last explain many lines which the learned will think
impossible to be mistaken, and omit many for which the
ignorant will want his help. These are censures merely
relative, and must be quietly endured. I have endeavoured
to be neither superfluously copious, nor scrupulously
reserved, and hope that I have made my author's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
meaning accessible to many who before were frighted
from perusing him, and contributed something to the
publick, by diffusing innocent and rational pleasure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The complete explanation of an author not systematick
and consequential, but desultory and vagrant, abounding
in casual allusions and light hints, is not to be expected
from any single scholiast. All personal reflections, when
names are suppressed, must be in a few years irrecoverably
obliterated; and customs, too minute to attract the notice
of law, such as modes of dress, formalities of conversation,
rules of visits, disposition of furniture, and practices of
ceremony, which naturally find places in familiar dialogue,
are so fugitive and unsubstantial, that they are not easily
retained or recovered. What can be known will be
collected by chance, from the recesses of obscure and
obsolete papers, perused commonly with some other view.
Of this knowledge every man has some, and none has
much; but when an author has engaged the publick
attention, those who can add any thing to his illustration,
communicate their discoveries, and time produces what
had eluded diligence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To time I have been obliged to resign many passages,
which, though I did not understand them, will perhaps
hereafter be explained, having, I hope, illustrated some,
which others have neglected or mistaken, sometimes by
short remarks, or marginal directions, such as every editor
has added at his will, and often by comments more
laborious than the matter will seem to deserve; but that
which is most difficult is not always most important, and
to an editor nothing is a trifle by which his author is
obscured.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The poetical beauties or defects I have not been very
diligent to observe. Some plays have more, and some
fewer judicial observations, not in proportion to their
difference of merit, but because I gave this part of my
design to chance and to caprice. The reader, I believe, is
seldom pleased to find his opinion anticipated; it is
natural to delight more in what we find or make, than in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what we receive. Judgment, like other faculties, is
improved by practice, and its advancement is hindered by
submission to dictatorial decisions, as the memory grows
torpid by the use of a table-book. Some initiation is
however necessary; of all skill, part is infused by precept,
and part is obtained by habit; I have therefore shewn so
much as may enable the candidate of criticism to discover
the rest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the end of most plays I have added short strictures,
containing a general censure of faults, or praise of excellence;
in which I know not how much I have concurred
with the current opinion; but I have not, by any affectation
of singularity, deviated from it. Nothing is minutely
and particularly examined, and therefore it is to be
supposed that in the plays which are condemned there is
much to be praised, and in these which are praised much
to be condemned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The part of criticism in which the whole succession of
editors has laboured with the greatest diligence, which has
occasioned the most arrogant ostentation, and excited the
keenest acrimony, is the emendation of corrupted passages,
to which the publick attention having been first drawn by
the violence of the contention between Pope and Theobald,
has been continued by the persecution, which, with a
kind of conspiracy, has been since raised against all the
publishers of Shakespeare.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That many passages have passed in a state of depravation
through all the editions is indubitably certain; of
these the restoration is only to be attempted by collation
of copies, or sagacity of conjecture. The collator's province
is safe and easy, the conjecturer's perilous and
difficult. Yet as the greater part of the plays are extant
only in one copy, the peril must not be avoided, nor
the difficulty refused.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the readings which this emulation of amendment
has hitherto produced, some from the labours of every
publisher I have advanced into the text; those are to be
considered as in my opinion sufficiently supported; some
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I have rejected without mention, as evidently erroneous;
some I have left in the notes without censure or approbation,
as resting in equipoise between objection and
defence; and some, which seemed specious but not
right, I have inserted with a subsequent animadversion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having classed the observations of others, I was at last
to try what I could substitute for their mistakes, and how
I could supply their omissions. I collated such copies as
I could procure, and wished for more, but have not found
the collectors of these rarities very communicative. Of
the editions which chance or kindness put into my hands
I have given an enumeration, that I may not be blamed
for neglecting what I had not the power to do.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By examining the old copies, I soon found that the
later publishers, with all their boasts of diligence, suffered
many passages to stand unauthorized, and contented
themselves with Rowe's regulation of the text, even
where they knew it to be arbitrary, and with a little consideration
might have found it to be wrong. Some of
these alterations are only the ejection of a word for
one that appeared to him more elegant or more intelligible.
These corruptions I have often silently rectified;
for the history of our language, and the true force of our
words, can only be preserved, by keeping the text of
authors free from adulteration. Others, and those very
frequent, smoothed the cadence, or regulated the measure;
on these I have not exercised the same rigour; if only a
word was transposed, or a particle inserted or omitted, I
have sometimes suffered the line to stand; for the inconstancy
of the copies is such, as that some liberties may be
easily permitted. But this practice I have not suffered
to proceed far, having restored the primitive diction
wherever it could for any reason be preferred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The emendations which comparison of copies supplied,
I have inserted in the text; sometimes, where the
improvement was slight, without notice, and sometimes
with an account of the reasons of the change.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Conjecture, though it be sometimes unavoidable, I have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not wantonly nor licentiously indulged. It has been my
settled principle, that the reading of the ancient books is
probably true, and therefore is not to be disturbed for the
sake of elegance, perspicuity, or mere improvement of the
sense. For though much credit is not due to the fidelity,
nor any to the judgment of the first publishers, yet they
who had the copy before their eyes were more likely to
read it right, than we who read it only by imagination.
But it is evident that they have often made strange mistakes
by ignorance or negligence, and that therefore
something may be properly attempted by criticism,
keeping the middle way between presumption and
timidity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such criticism I have attempted to practise, and, where
any passage appeared inextricably perplexed, have endeavoured
to discover how it may be recalled to sense,
with least violence. But my first labour is, always
to turn the old text on every side, and try if there be
any interstice, through which light can find its way; nor
would Huetius himself condemn me, as refusing the
trouble of research, for the ambition of alteration.
In this modest industry I have not been unsuccessful.
I have rescued many lines from the violations of temerity,
and secured many scenes from the inroads of
correction. I have adopted the Roman sentiment,
that it is more honourable to save a citizen, than to
kill an enemy, and have been more careful to protect
than to attack.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have preserved the common distribution of the plays
into acts, though I believe it to be in almost all the
plays void of authority. Some of those which are
divided in the later editions have no division in the
first folio, and some that are divided in the folio have
no division in the preceding copies. The settled mode
of the theatre requires four intervals in the play, but
few, if any, of our author's compositions can be properly
distributed in that manner. An act is so much of the
drama as passes without intervention of time, or change
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of place. A pause makes a new act. In every real,
and therefore in every imitative action, the intervals may
be more or fewer, the restriction of five acts being
accidental and arbitrary. This Shakespeare knew, and
this he practised; his plays were written, and at first
printed in one unbroken continuity, and ought now to
be exhibited with short pauses, interposed as often as the
scene is changed, or any considerable time is required to
pass. This method would at once quell a thousand
absurdities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In restoring the author's works to their integrity, I
have considered the punctuation as wholly in my power;
for what could be their care of colons and commas, who
corrupted words and sentences. Whatever could be done
by adjusting points is therefore silently performed, in
some plays with much diligence, in others with less; it
is hard to keep a busy eye steadily fixed upon evanescent
atoms, or a discursive mind upon evanescent truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same liberty has been taken with a few particles, or
other words of slight effect. I have sometimes inserted
or omitted them without notice. I have done that
sometimes which the other editors have done always,
and which indeed the state of the text may sufficiently
justify.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The greater part of readers, instead of blaming us for
passing trifles, will wonder that on mere trifles so much
labour is expended, with such importance of debate, and
such solemnity of diction. To these I answer with confidence,
that they are judging of an art which they do not
understand; yet cannot much reproach them with their
ignorance, nor promise that they would become in
general, by learning criticism, more useful, happier, or
wiser.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As I practised conjecture more, I learned to trust it
less; and after I had printed a few plays, resolved to
insert none of my own readings in the text. Upon this
caution I now congratulate myself, for every day encreases
my doubt of my emendations.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since I have confined my imagination to the margin,
it must not be considered as very reprehensible, if I
have suffered it to play some freaks in its own dominion.
There is no danger in conjecture, if it be proposed as
conjecture; and while the text remains uninjured, those
changes may be safely offered, which are not considered
even by him that offers them as necessary or safe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If my readings are of little value, they have not been
ostentatiously displayed or importunately obtruded. I
could have written longer notes, for the art of writing
notes is not of difficult attainment. The work is performed,
first by railing at the stupidity, negligence,
ignorance, and asinine tastelessness of the former editors,
and shewing, from all that goes before and all that
follows, the inelegance and absurdity of the old reading;
then by proposing something, which to superficial readers
would seem specious, but which the editor rejects with
indignation; then by producing the true reading, with a
long paraphrase, and concluding with loud acclamations
on the discovery, and a sober wish for the advancement
and prosperity of genuine criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this may be done, and perhaps done sometimes
without impropriety. But I have always suspected that
the reading is right, which requires many words to prove
it wrong; and the emendation wrong, that cannot without
so much labour appear to be right. The justness
of a happy restoration strikes at once, and the moral
precept may be well applied to criticism,

To dread the shore which he sees spread with wrecks,
is natural to the sailor. I had before my eye so many
critical adventures ended in miscarriage, that caution was
forced upon me. I encountered in every page wit
struggling with its own sophistry, and learning confused
by the multiplicity of its views. I was forced to censure
those whom I admired, and could not but
reflect, while I was dispossessing their emendations, how
soon the same fate might happen to my own, and how
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
many of the readings which I have corrected may be

That a conjectural critick should often be mistaken,
cannot be wonderful, either to others or himself, if it
be considered, that in his art there is no system, no
principal and axiomatical truth that regulates subordinate
positions. His chance of error is renewed at every
attempt; an oblique view of the passage, a slight misapprehension
of a phrase, a casual inattention to the
parts connected, is sufficient to make him not only fail,
but fail ridiculously; and when he succeeds best, he
produces perhaps but one reading of many probable, and
he that suggests another will always be able to dispute
his claims.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is an unhappy state in which danger is hid under
pleasure. The allurements of emendation are scarcely
resistible. Conjecture has all the joy and all the pride
of invention, and he that has once started a happy
change, is too much delighted to consider what objections
may rise against it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet conjectural criticism has been of great use in the
learned world; nor is it my intention to depreciate a
study that has exercised so many mighty minds, from
the revival of learning to our own age, from the bishop
of Aleria to English Bentley. The criticks on ancient
authors have, in the exercise of their sagacity, many
assistances, which the editor of Shakespeare is condemned
to want. They are employed upon grammatical and
settled languages, whose construction contributes so much
to perspicuity, that Homer has fewer passages unintelligible
than Chaucer. The words have not only a
known regimen, but invariable quantities, which direct
and confine the choice. There are commonly more
manuscripts than one; and they do not often conspire
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the same mistakes. Yet Scaliger could confess to
Salmasius how little satisfaction his emendations gave
him. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Illudunt nobis conjecturæ nostræ, quarum nos pudet,
posteaquam in meliores codices incidimus.</span></span> And Lipsius
could complain that criticks were making faults by
trying to remove them, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ut olim vitiis, ita nunc remediis
laboratur.</span></span> And indeed, when mere conjecture is to be
used, the emendations of Scaliger and Lipsius, notwithstanding
their wonderful sagacity and erudition, are
often vague and disputable, like mine or Theobald's.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps I may not be more censured for doing
wrong, than for doing little; for raising in the publick
expectations, which at last I have not answered.
The expectation of ignorance is indefinite, and that of
knowledge is often tyrannical. It is hard to satisfy
those who know not what to demand, or those who
demand by design what they think impossible to be
done. I have indeed disappointed no opinion more
than my own; yet I have endeavoured to perform
my task with no slight solicitude. Not a single
passage in the whole work has appeared to me corrupt,
which I have not attempted to restore; or obscure,
which I have not endeavoured to illustrate. In many
I have failed like others; and from many, after all
my efforts, I have retreated, and confessed the repulse.
I have not passed over, with affected superiority,
what is equally difficult to the reader and to myself,
but where I could not instruct him, have owned my
ignorance. I might easily have accumulated a mass of
seeming learning upon easy scenes; but it ought not
to be imputed to negligence, that, where nothing was
necessary, nothing has been done, or that, where others
have said enough, I have said no more.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notes are often necessary, but they are necessary
evils. Let him that is yet unacquainted with the
powers of Shakespeare, and who desires to feel the
highest pleasure that the drama can give, read every
play, from the first scene to the last, with utter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
negligence of all his commentators. When his fancy
is once on the wing, let it not stoop at correction or
explanation. When his attention is strongly engaged,
let it disdain alike to turn aside to the name of
Theobald and of Pope. Let him read on through brightness
and obscurity, through integrity and corruption;
let him preserve his comprehension of the dialogue
and his interest in the fable. And when the pleasures
of novelty have ceased, let him attempt exactness, and
read the commentators.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Particular passages are cleared by notes, but the general
effect of the work is weakened. The mind is refrigerated
by interruption; the thoughts are diverted from the
principal subject; the reader is weary, he suspects not
why; and at last throws away the book which he has too
diligently studied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Parts are not to be examined till the whole has been
surveyed; there is a kind of intellectual remoteness
necessary for the comprehension of any great work in its

shews the smaller niceties, but the beauty of the whole is
discerned no longer.

It is not very grateful to consider how little the
succession of editors has added to this author's power
of pleasing. He was read, admired, studied, and imitated,
while he was yet deformed with all the improprieties
which ignorance and neglect could accumulate upon him;
while the reading was yet not rectified, nor his allusions
understood; yet then did Dryden pronounce, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
Shakespeare was the man, who, of all modern and perhaps
ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive
soul.”</span> All the images of nature were still present to him,
and he drew them not laboriously, but luckily: when he
describes any thing, you more than see it, you feel it
too. Those who accuse him to have wanted learning,
give him the greater commendation: he was naturally
learned: he needed not the spectacles of books to read
nature; he looked inwards, and found her there. I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cannot say he is every where alike; were he so, I should
do him injury to compare him with the greatest of mankind.
He is many times flat and insipid; his comick
wit degenerating into clenches, his serious swelling into
bombast. But he is always great, when some great
occasion is presented to him: no man can say, he ever
had a fit subject for his wit, and did not then raise himself
as high above the rest of poets,

It is to be lamented that such a writer should want
a commentary; that his language should become obsolete,
or his sentiments obscure. But it is vain to carry wishes
beyond the condition of human things; that which must
happen to all, has happened to Shakespeare, by accident
and time: and more than has been suffered by any other
writer since the use of types, has been suffered by him
through his own negligence of fame, or perhaps by that
superiority of mind, which despised its own performances,
when it compared them with its powers, and judged those
works unworthy to be preserved, which the criticks of
following ages were to contend for the fame of restoring
and explaining.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among these candidates of inferior fame, I am now
to stand the judgment of the publick; and wish that
I could confidently produce my commentary as equal to
the encouragement which I have had the honour of

deficient, and I should feel little solicitude about the
sentence, were it to be pronounced only by the skilful
and the learned.

removed before: a very little <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Analogy</span></span> will do the business.
I shall therefore have no occasion to trouble myself
any further; and may venture to call my Pamphlet, in
the words of a pleasant Declaimer against <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sermons on the

But <span class="tei tei-q">“this method of reasoning will prove any one
ignorant of the Languages, who hath written when
Translations were extant.”</span>—Shade of Burgersdicius!—does
it follow, because Shakespeare's early life was incompatible
with a course of Education—whose Contemporaries,
Friends and Foes, nay, and himself likewise,
agree in his want of what is usually called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Literature</span></span>—whose
mistakes from equivocal Translations, and even
typographical Errors, cannot possibly be accounted for
otherwise,—that Locke, to whom not one of these circumstances
is applicable, understood no Greek?—I suspect,
Rollin's Opinion of our Philosopher was not founded on
this argument.

him above all other men. The quotation from Lilly in
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Taming of the Shrew</span></span>, if indeed it be his, strongly
proves the extent of his reading: had he known Terence,
he would not have quoted erroneously from his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grammar</span></span>.

You have long known my opinion concerning the
literary acquisitions of our immortal Dramatist; and remember
how I congratulated myself on my coincidence
with the last and best of his Editors. I told you, however,
that his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">small Latin and less Greek</span></span> would still be litigated,
and you see very assuredly that I was not mistaken. The
trumpet hath been sounded against <span class="tei tei-q">“the darling project
of representing Shakespeare as one of the illiterate vulgar”</span>;
and indeed to so good purpose, that I would by all
means recommend the performer to the army of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">braying
Faction</span></span>, recorded by Cervantes. The testimony of
his contemporaries is again disputed; constant tradition is
opposed by flimsy arguments; and nothing is heard but
confusion and nonsense. One could scarcely imagine
this a topick very likely to inflame the passions: it is
asserted by Dryden, that <span class="tei tei-q">“those who accuse him to have
wanted learning, give him the greatest commendation”</span>;
yet an attack upon an article of faith hath been usually
received with more temper and complacence, than the
unfortunate opinion which I am about to defend.

But let us previously lament, with every lover of Shakespeare,
that the Question was not fully discussed by Mr.
Johnson himself: what he sees intuitively, others must
arrive at by a series of proofs; and I have not time to

cursory observations, as they may happen to arise from
the Chaos of Papers you have so often laughed at, <span class="tei tei-q">“a

But whence have we the Plot of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Timon</span></span>, except from
the Greek of Lucian?—The Editors and Criticks have been
never at a greater loss than in their inquiries of this sort;
and the source of a Tale hath been often in vain sought
abroad, which might easily have been found at home:
My good friend, the very ingenious Editor of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Reliques of ancient English Poetry</span></span>, hath shewn our Author
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to have been sometimes contented with a legendary
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ballad</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Story of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Misanthrope</span></span> is told in almost every
Collection of the time; and particularly in two books,
with which Shakespeare was intimately acquainted; the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Palace of Pleasure</span></span>, and the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English Plutarch</span></span>. Indeed
from a passage in an old Play, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jack Drum's Entertainment</span></span>,
I conjecture that he had before made his
appearance on the Stage.

Were this a proper place for such a disquisition, I could
give you many cases of this kind. We are sent for
instance to Cinthio for the Plot of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Measure for Measure</span></span>,
and Shakespeare's judgement hath been attacked for some
deviations from him in the conduct of it: when probably
all he knew of the matter was from Madam Isabella in
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heptameron</span></span> of Whetstone. Ariosto is continually
quoted for the Fable of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Much ado about Nothing</span></span>; but
I suspect our Poet to have been satisfied with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Geneura</span></span>
of Turberville. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As you like it</span></span> was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly borrowed</span></em>,

Tale of Gamelyn</span></span>; which by the way was not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">printed</span></em> 'till
a century afterward: when in truth the old Bard, who
was no hunter of MSS., contented himself solely with
Lodge's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rosalynd</span></span> or Euphues'
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Golden Legacye</span></span>. 4to. 1590.
The Story of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">All's well that ends well</span></span>, or, as I suppose it
to have been sometimes called, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Love's labour wonne</span></span>, is
originally indeed the property of Boccace, but it came
immediately to Shakespeare from Painter's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Giletta of
Narbon</span></span>. Mr. Langbaine could not conceive whence the
Story of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pericles</span></span> could be taken, <span class="tei tei-q">“not meeting in History
with any such <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prince of Tyre</span></span>”</span>; yet his legend may be
found at large in old Gower, under the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Appolynus</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pericles</span></span> is one of the Plays omitted in the later
Editions, as well as the early Folios, and not improperly;
tho' it was published many years before the death of
Shakespeare, with his name in the Title-page. Aulus
Gellius informs us that some Plays are ascribed absolutely
to Plautus, which he only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">re-touched</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">polished</span></em>; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this is undoubtedly the case with our Author likewise.
The revival of this performance, which Ben Jonson calls
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stale</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mouldy</span></em>, was probably his earliest attempt in
the Drama. I know that another of these discarded
pieces, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yorkshire Tragedy</span></span>, had been frequently called
so; but most certainly it was not written by our Poet at
all: nor indeed was it printed in his life-time. The Fact
on which it is built was perpetrated no sooner than 1604:
much too late for so mean a performance from the hand
of Shakespeare.

Sometimes a very little matter detects a forgery. You

a posthumous one of Shakespeare: and I see it is classed
as such in the last Edition of the Bodleian Catalogue.
Mr. Pope himself, after all the strictures of Scriblerus,

mistaken accent determines it to have been written since

To whom then shall we ascribe it?—Somebody hath
told us, who should seem to be a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nostrum-monger</span></span> by his
argument, that, let <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Accents</span></em> be how they will, it is called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an original Play of William Shakespeare</span></em>
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kings Patent</span></span>,
prefixed to Mr. Theobald's Edition, 1728, and consequently
there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> be no fraud in the matter. Whilst, on
the contrary, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Laureat, Mr. Victor, remarks (and
were it true, it would be certainly decisive) that the Plot
is borrowed from a Novel of Cervantes, not published 'till
the year after Shakespeare's death. But unluckily the
same Novel appears in a part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Don Quixote</span></span>, which was
printed in Spanish, 1605, and in English by Shelton,
1612.—The same reasoning, however, which exculpated
our Author from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yorkshire Tragedy</span></span>, may be applied
on the present occasion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But you want <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em> opinion:—and from every mark of
Style and Manner, I make no doubt of ascribing it to
Shirley. Mr. Langbaine informs us that he left some
Plays in MS.—These were written about the time of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Restoration</span></span>, when the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Accent</span></em> in question was more
generally altered.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the mistake arose from an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abbreviation</span></em> of the
name. Mr. Dodsley knew not that the Tragedy of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andromana</span></span> was Shirley's, from the very same cause.
Thus a whole stream of Biographers tell us that Marston's
Plays were printed at London, 1633, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the care of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William Shakespeare</span></span>, the famous Comedian.”</span>—Here again
I suppose, in some Transcript, the real Publisher's name,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William Sheares</span></span>, was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abbreviated</span></em>. No one hath
protracted the life of Shakespeare beyond 1616, except Mr. Hume;
who is pleased to add a year to it, in contradiction to all
manner of evidence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shirley is spoken of with contempt in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mac Flecknoe</span></span>;
but his Imagination is sometimes fine to an extraordinary
degree. I recollect a passage in the fourth book of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paradise Lost</span></span>, which hath
been suspected of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Imitation</span></em>, as

to Heaven on a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sunbeam</span></em>.
Dr. Newton informs us that this might possibly
be hinted by a Picture of Annibal Caracci in the King of
France's Cabinet: but I am apt to believe that Milton had
been struck with a Portrait in Shirley. Fernando, in the
Comedy of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brothers</span></span>, 1652,
describes Jacinta at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vespers</span></span>:

But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to return</span></em>, as we say on other occasions—Perhaps
the Advocates for Shakespeare's knowledge of the Latin
language may be more successful. Mr. Gildon takes
the Van. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is plain that He was acquainted with the
Fables of antiquity very well: that some of the Arrows of
Cupid are pointed with Lead, and others with Gold, he
found in Ovid; and what he speaks of Dido, in Virgil:
nor do I know any translation of these Poets so ancient
as Shakespeare's time.”</span> The passages on which these
sagacious remarks are made occur in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midsummer
Night's Dream</span></span>; and exhibit, we see, a clear proof of
acquaintance with the Latin Classicks. But we are not
answerable for Mr. Gildon's ignorance; he might have
been told of Caxton and Douglas, of Surrey and Stanyhurst,
of Phaer and Twyne, of Fleming and Golding, of
Turberville and Churchyard! but these Fables were easily
known without the help of either the originals or the
translations. The Fate of Dido had been sung very early
by Gower, Chaucer, and Lydgate; Marloe had even already
introduced her to the Stage: and Cupid's arrows appear
with their characteristick differences in Surrey, in Sidney,
in Spenser, and every Sonnetteer of the time. Nay, their
very names were exhibited long before in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romaunt of
the Rose</span></span>: a work you may venture to look into, notwithstanding
Master Prynne hath so positively assured us, on

too late for this imitation: but I have a Copy in

Our excellent friend Mr. Hurd hath born a noble
testimony on our side of the question. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shakespeare,”</span>
says this true Critick, <span class="tei tei-q">“owed the felicity of freedom from
the bondage of classical superstition to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">want</span></em> of what
is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">advantage</span></em> of a learned Education.—This, as
well as a vast superiority of Genius, hath contributed to
lift this astonishing man to the glory of being esteemed
the most original <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thinker</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speaker</span></em>, since the times of
Homer.”</span> And hence indisputably the amazing Variety
of Style and Manner, unknown to all other Writers: an
argument of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">itself</span></em> sufficient to emancipate Shakespeare
from the supposition of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Classical training</span></span>. Yet, to be
honest, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> Imitation is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fastened</span></em> on our Poet: which

ones subjoined to the Works of Surrey. Nay,

which his Hero so fatally depended. <span class="tei tei-q">“He had learned

Macbeth was certainly one of Shakespeare's latest Productions,
and it might possibly have been suggested to
him by a little performance on the same subject at Oxford,
before King James, 1605. I will transcribe my notice of
it from Wake's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rex Platonicus</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Fabulæ ansam dedit

A stronger argument hath been brought from the Plot
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>. Dr. Grey and Mr. Whalley assure us that
for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> Shakespeare <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em>
have read <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saxo Grammaticus</span></span> in
Latin, for no translation hath been made into any modern
Language. But the truth is, he did not take it from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saxo</span></span>
at all; a Novel called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hystorie of Hamblet</span></span> was his
original: a fragment of which, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">black Letter</span></em>, I have been

to whom the lovers of Shakespeare will some time or other
owe great obligations.

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such an history exists</span></em>,
it is almost impossible that any poet unacquainted with the

Very luckily, our Fragment gives us a part of Hamlet's
Speech to his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mother</span></em>, which sufficiently replies to this

made no conscience to kill his owne brother (accustomed
to murthers, and allured with desire of gouernement without
controll in his treasons) will not spare to saue himselfe
with the like crueltie, in the blood and flesh of the
loyns of his brother, by him massacred: and therefore it
is better for me to fayne madnesse then to use my right
sences as nature hath bestowed them upon me. The

for me, to the end that, guiding my self wisely therin,
I may preserue my life for the Danes and the memory of
my late deceased father, for that the desire of reuenging
his death is so ingrauen in my heart, that if I dye not
shortly, I hope to take such and so great vengeance, that
these Countryes shall for euer speake thereof. Neuerthelesse
I must stay the time, meanes, and occasion, lest by
making ouer great hast I be now the cause of mine owne
sodaine ruine and ouerthrow, and by that meanes end,
before I beginne to effect my hearts desire: hee that hath
to doe with a wicked, disloyall, cruell, and discourteous

But to put the matter out of all question, my communicative
Friend above-mentioned, Mr. Capell (for why
should I not give myself the credit of his name?), hath
been fortunate enough to procure from the Collection of

chief incidents of the Play, and all the capital Characters,
are there in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">embryo</span></em>, after a rude and barbarous manner:

borrow; nor any expression but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, which is, where
Hamlet kills Polonius behind the arras: in doing which
he is made to cry out, as in the Play, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a rat, a rat!</span></em>’</span> ”</span>—So

With respect to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">resemblances</span></em>, I shall not trouble you
any further.—That the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedy of Errors</span></span> is founded on
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menæchmi</span></span>, it is notorious: nor is it less so, that a
Translation of it by W. W., perhaps William Warner, the
Author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Albion's England</span></span>, was extant in the time of
Shakespeare; tho' Mr. Upton, and some other advocates
for his learning, have cautiously dropt the mention
of it. Besides this (if indeed it were different), in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gesta Grayorum</span></span>, the Christmas Revels of the Gray's-Inn
Gentlemen, 1594, <span class="tei tei-q">“a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedy of Errors</span></span> like to Plautus
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menechmus</span></span> was played by the Players.”</span> And the
same hath been suspected to be the Subject of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">goodlie
Comedie of Plautus</span></span> acted at Greenwich before the King
and Queen in 1520; as we learn from Hall and Holingshed:—Riccoboni
highly compliments the English on
opening their stage so well; but unfortunately Cavendish,
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life of Wolsey</span></span>, calls it an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">excellent Interlude in
Latine</span></em>. About the same time it was exhibited in German

the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shoemaker</span></span>.

<span class="tei tei-q">“But a character in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Taming of the Shrew</span></span> is borrowed

Mr. Colman indeed hath been better employ'd: but
if he had met with an old Comedy, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Supposes</span></span>,
translated from Ariosto by George Gascoigne, he certainly
would not have appealed to Plautus. Thence
Shakespeare borrowed this part of the Plot (as well as
some of the phraseology), though Theobald pronounces
it his own invention: there likewise he found the quaint
name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Petruchio</span></span>. My young Master and his Man
exchange habits and characters, and persuade a Scenæse,
as he is called, to personate the Father, exactly as in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Taming of the Shrew</span></span>, by the pretended danger of his
coming from Sienna to Ferrara, contrary to the order of
the government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still, Shakespeare quotes a line from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuch</span></span> of
Terence: by memory too, and, what is more, <span class="tei tei-q">“purposely
alters it, in order to bring the sense within the compass of
one line.”</span>—This remark was previous to Mr. Johnson's;
or indisputably it would not have been made at all.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Our
Authour had this line from Lilly; which I mention
that it may not be brought as an argument of his
learning.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But how, cries an unprovoked Antagonist, can you
take upon you to say that he had it from Lilly, and
not from Terence? I will answer for Mr. Johnson,
who is above answering for himself.—Because it is quoted
as it appears in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grammarian</span></span>, and not as it appears in
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poet</span></span>.—And thus
we have done with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purposed</span></em>
alteration. Udall likewise in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Floures for Latine
speakyng, gathered oute of Terence</span></span>, 1560, reduces the
passage to a single line, and subjoins a Translation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have hitherto supposed Shakespeare the Author of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Taming of the Shrew</span></span>, but his property in it is extremely
disputable. I will give you my opinion, and
the reasons on which it is founded. I suppose then the
present Play not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">originally</span></em> the work of Shakespeare, but
restored by him to the Stage, with the whole Induction
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Tinker, and some other occasional improvements;
especially in the Character of Petruchio. It is very
obvious that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Induction</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Play</span></span> were either the
works of different hands, or written at a great interval
of time: the former is in our Author's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">best</span></em> manner, and
the greater part of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">latter</span></em> in his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">worst</span></em>, or even below
it. Dr. Warburton declares it to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly</span></em> spurious:
and without doubt, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supposing</span></em> it to have been written by
Shakespeare, it must have been one of his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earliest</span></em> productions;
yet it is not mentioned in the List of his Works
by Meres in 1598.

an allusion to the old Play: <span class="tei tei-q">“Read the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">booke</span></em> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Taming

And in fact there is such an old <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anonymous</span></em> Play in

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Taming of a Shrew</span></span>—sundry times acted by the Earl
of Pembroke his Servants.”</span> Which seems to have been
republished by the Remains of that Company in 1607,
when Shakespeare's copy appeared at the Black-Friars
or the Globe.—Nor let this seem derogatory from the
character of our Poet. There is no reason to believe that
he wanted to claim the Play as his own; it was not even
printed 'till some years after his death: but he merely
revived it on his Stage as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Manager</span></em>.—Ravenscroft assures
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
us that this was really the case with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Titus Andronicus</span></span>;
which, it may be observed, hath not Shakespeare's name
on the Title-page of the only Edition published in his
life-time. Indeed, from every internal mark, I have not
the least doubt but this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">horrible</span></em> Piece was originally
written by the Author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lines</span></span> thrown into the mouth
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Player</span></span> in

which likewise, from some assistance perhaps given to his
Friend, hath been unjustly and ignorantly charged upon
Shakespeare.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sheet-anchor</span></em> holds fast: Shakespeare himself
hath left some Translations from Ovid. The Epistles,
says One, of Paris and Helen give a sufficient proof of
his acquaintance with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> poet; and it may be concluded,
says Another, that he was a competent judge of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em>
Authors who wrote in the same language.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This hath been the universal cry, from Mr. Pope himself
to the Criticks of yesterday. Possibly, however, the
Gentlemen will hesitate a moment, if we tell them that
Shakespeare was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the Author of these Translations.
Let them turn to a forgotten book, by Thomas Heywood,
called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Britaines Troy</span></span>, printed by W. Jaggard in 1609, Fol.
and they will find these identical Epistles, <span class="tei tei-q">“which being

confuted by the date 1581, when Shakespeare was only

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
instrument from the Herald's office, so frequently reprinted.—Shakespeare
most certainly went to London,
and commenced Actor thro' necessity, not natural inclination.—Nor
have we any reason to suppose that he
did act <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exceedingly well</span></em>. Rowe tells us from the information
of Betterton, who was inquisitive into this point,
and had very early opportunities of Inquiry from Sir W.
Davenant, that he was no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extraordinary Actor</span></em>; and that
the top of his performance was the Ghost in his own
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>. Yet this
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Chef d'Oeuvre</span></span> did not please: I will give
you an original stroke at it. Dr. Lodge, who was for
ever pestering the town with Pamphlets, published in the
year 1596 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wits miserie, and the Worlds madnesse, discovering
the Devils incarnat of this Age.</span></span> 4to. One of these
Devils is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hate-virtue</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sorrow for another mans good
successe</span></span>, who, says the Doctor, is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a foule lubber</span></em>, and
looks as pale as the Visard of the Ghost, which cried
so miserably at the Theatre, like an Oister-wife, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet
revenge</span></span>.”</span> Thus you see Mr. Holt's supposed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proof</span></em>, in
the Appendix to the late Edition, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> was written
after 1597, or perhaps 1602, will by no means hold good;
whatever might be the case of the particular passage on
which it is founded.

Nor does it appear that Shakespeare did begin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">early</span></em> to

the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arraignment of Paris</span></span>,
1584, which hath so often been ascribed to him on the
credit of Kirkman and Winstanley, was written by George
Peele; and Shakespeare is not met with, even as an
Assistant, 'till at least seven years afterward.—Nash, in his
Epistle to the Gentlemen Students of both Universities,
prefixed to Greene's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arcadia</span></span>,

Artifex</span></span>: whose first increase, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arraignment of Paris</span></span>,

And to close the whole, it is not possible, according to
Aubrey himself, that Shakespeare could have been some
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">years a Schoolmaster in the Country</span></em>: on which circumstance
only the supposition of his learning is professedly founded.
He was not surely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em> young, when he was employed to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kill Calves</span></em>, and he commenced Player about <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eighteen</span></em>!—The
truth is that he left his Father, for a Wife, a year
sooner; and had at least two Children born at Stratford
before he retired from thence to London. It is therefore
sufficiently clear that poor Anthony had too much reason
for his character of Aubrey: You will find it in his own
Account of his Life, published by Hearne, which I would
earnestly recommend to any Hypochondriack;

We have but few observations concerning Shakespeare's
knowledge of the Spanish tongue. Dr. Grey indeed is
willing to suppose that the plot of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romeo and Juliet</span></span> may
be borrowed from a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Comedy</span></span> of Lopes de Vega. But the
Spaniard, who was certainly acquainted with Bandello,
hath not only changed the Catastrophe, but the names of
the Characters. Neither Romeo nor Juliet, neither
Montague nor Capulet, appears in this performance: and
how came they to the knowledge of Shakespeare?—Nothing
is more certain than that he chiefly followed the
Translation by Painter from the French of Boisteau, and
hence arise the Deviations from Bandello's original Italian.
It seems, however, from a passage in Ames's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Typographical
Antiquities</span></span>, that Painter was not the only Translator of
this popular Story: and it is possible, therefore, that
Shakespeare might have other assistance.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may observe in general, that the early Editions
have not half the quantity; and every sentence, or rather
every word, most ridiculously blundered. These, for
several reasons, could not possibly be published by the
Author; and it is extremely probable that the French
ribaldry was at first inserted by a different hand, as the
many additions most certainly were after he had left the
Stage.—Indeed, every friend to his memory will not easily
believe that he was acquainted with the Scene between
Catharine and the old Gentlewoman; or surely he would
not have admitted such obscenity and nonsense.

of the French language may not be changed since
Shakespeare's time; <span class="tei tei-q">“if not,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“it may be

but this does not appear to be the case, at least in this
termination, from the rules of the Grammarians, or the
practice of the Poets. I am certain of the former from
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French Alphabet</span></span> of De la
Mothe, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orthoepia
Gallica</span></span> of John Eliot; and of the latter from the Rhymes
of Marot, Ronsard, and Du Bartas.—Connections of this
kind were very common. Shakespeare himself assisted

the Part of the Clown in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry the fifth</span></span>; but no such

The following sheets were written in consequence of a
friendly conversation, turning by some chance upon the
Character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Falstaff</span></span>, wherein the Writer, maintaining,
contrary to the general Opinion, that this Character was
not intended to be shewn as a Coward, he was challenged
to deliver and support that Opinion from the Press, with
an engagement, now he fears forgotten, for it was three
years ago, that he should be answered thro' the same
channel: Thus stimulated, these papers were almost
wholly written in a very short time, but not without
those attentions, whether successful or not, which seemed
necessary to carry them beyond the Press into the hands
of the Public. From the influence of the foregoing
circumstances it is, that the Writer has generally assumed
rather the character and tone of an Advocate than of
an Inquirer;—though if he had not first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inquired</span></em> and
been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">convinced</span></em>, he should never have attempted to have
amused either himself or others with the subject.—The
impulse of the occasion, however, being passed, the
papers were thrown by, and almost forgotten: But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
having been looked into of late by some friends, who,
observing that the Writer had not enlarged so far for
the sake of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Falstaff</span></span> alone, but that the Argument
was made subservient to Critical amusement, persuaded
him to revise and convey it to the Press. This has
been accordingly done, though he fears something too
hastily, as he found it proper to add, while the papers
were in the course of printing, some considerations on
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Whole</span></em> Character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Falstaff</span></span>; which ought to
have been accompanied by a slight reform of a few preceding
passages, which may seem, in consequence of this
addition, to contain too favourable a representation of
his Morals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The vindication of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Falstaff's</span></span> Courage is truly no
otherwise the object than some old fantastic Oak, or
grotesque Rock, may be the object of a morning's ride;
yet being proposed as such, may serve to limit the
distance, and shape the course: The real object is
Exercise, and the Delight which a rich, beautiful, picturesque,
and perhaps unknown Country, may excite
from every side. Such an Exercise may admit of some
little excursion, keeping however the Road in view;
but seems to exclude every appearance of labour and
of toil.—Under the impression of such Feelings, the
Writer has endeavoured to preserve to his Text a certain
lightness of air, and chearfulness of tone; but is
sensible, however, that the manner of discussion does
not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every where</span></em>, particularly near the commencement,
sufficiently correspond with his design.—If the Book
shall be fortunate enough to obtain another Impression,
a separation may be made; and such of the heavier
parts as cannot be wholly dispensed with, sink to their
more proper station,—a Note.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He is fearful likewise that he may have erred in the
other extreme; and that having thought himself intitled,
even in argument, to a certain degree of playful
discussion, may have pushed it, in a few places, even
to levity. This error might be yet more easily
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reformed than the other.—The Book is perhaps, as it
stands, too bulky for the subject; but if the Reader
knew how many pressing considerations, as it grew into
size, the Author resisted, which yet seemed intitled to
be heard, he would the more readily excuse him.

Sir John Falstaff.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ideas which I have formed concerning the Courage
and Military Character of the Dramatic Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaff</span></span>
are so different from those which I find generally to
prevail in the world, that I shall take the liberty of
stating my sentiments on the subject; in hope that some
person, as unengaged as myself, will either correct and
reform my error in this respect; or, joining himself to
my opinion, redeem me from, what I may call, the
reproach of singularity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am to avow, then, that I do not clearly discern that
Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaff</span></span> deserves to bear the character so
generally given him of an absolute Coward; or, in other
words, that I do not conceive <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> ever meant
to make Cowardice an essential part of his constitution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know how universally the contrary opinion prevails;
and I know what respect and deference are due to the
public voice. But if to the avowal of this singularity
I add all the reasons that have led me to it, and acknowledge
myself to be wholly in the judgment of the public,
I shall hope to avoid the censure of too much forwardness
or indecorum.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must, in the first place, be admitted that the
appearances in this case are singularly strong and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
striking; and so they had need be, to become the
ground of so general a censure. We see this extraordinary
Character, almost in the first moment of our
acquaintance with him, involved in circumstances of
apparent dishonour; and we hear him familiarly called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Coward</span></em> by his most intimate companions. We see him,
on occasion of the robbery at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gads-Hill</span></span>, in the very act
of running away from the Prince and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>; and we
behold him, on another of more honourable obligation,
in open day light, in battle, and acting in his profession
as a Soldier, escaping from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Douglas</span></span> even out of the world
as it were; counterfeiting death, and deserting his very
existence; and we find him, on the former occasion,
betrayed into those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lies</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">braggadocioes</span></em> which are the
usual concomitants of Cowardice in Military men, and
pretenders to valour. These are not only in themselves
strong circumstances, but they are moreover thrust forward,
prest upon our notice as the subject of our mirth,
as the great business of the scene: No wonder, therefore,
that the word should go forth that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> exhibited as
a character of Cowardice and dishonour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What there is to the contrary of this, it is my business
to discover. Much, I think, will presently appear; but
it lies so dispersed, is so latent, and so purposely obscured,
that the reader must have some patience whilst I collect
it into one body, and make it the object of a steady
and regular contemplation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what have we to do, may my readers exclaim,
with principles <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so latent</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so obscured</span></em>? In Dramatic
composition the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Impression</span></em> is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fact</span></em>; and the Writer,
who, meaning to impress one thing, has impressed
another, is unworthy of observation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a very unpleasant thing to have, in the first setting
out, so many and so strong prejudices to contend with.
All that one can do in such case, is, to pray the reader to
have a little patience in the commencement; and to
reserve his censure, if it must pass, for the conclusion.
Under his gracious allowance, therefore, I presume to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
declare it as my opinion, that Cowardice <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not</span></em> the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Impression</span></em> which the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em>
character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is calculated
to make on the minds of an unprejudiced audience;
tho' there be, I confess, a great deal of something
in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">composition</span></em> likely enough to puzzle, and consequently
to mislead the Understanding.—The reader
will perceive that I distinguish between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental Impressions</span></em>
and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Understanding</span></em>.—I wish to avoid every thing that
looks like subtlety and refinement; but this is a distinction
which we all comprehend.—There are none of
us unconscious of certain feelings or sensations of mind
which do not seem to have passed thro' the Understanding;
the effects, I suppose, of some secret influences
from without, acting upon a certain mental sense, and
producing feelings and passions in just correspondence
to the force and variety of those influences on the one
hand, and to the quickness of our sensibility on the other.
Be the cause, however, what it may, the fact is undoubtedly
so; which is all I am concerned in. And it
is equally a fact, which every man's experience may
avouch, that the Understanding and those feelings are
frequently at variance. The latter often arise from the
most minute circumstances, and frequently from such as
the Understanding cannot estimate, or even recognize;
whereas the Understanding delights in abstraction, and
in general propositions; which, however true considered
as such, are very seldom, I had like to have said <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em>,
perfectly applicable to any particular case. And hence,
among other causes, it is, that we often condemn or
applaud characters and actions on the credit of some
logical process, while our hearts revolt, and would fain
lead us to a very different conclusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Understanding seems for the most part to take
cognizance of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actions</span></em> only, and from these to infer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motives</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character</span></em>; but the sense we have been speaking of
proceeds in a contrary course; and determines of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actions</span></em>
from certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first principles of character</span></em>, which seem wholly
out of the reach of the Understanding. We cannot
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indeed do otherwise than admit that there must be
distinct principles of character in every distinct individual:
The manifest variety even in the minds of infants will
oblige us to this. But what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> these first principles
of character? Not the objects, I am persuaded, of the
Understanding; and yet we take as strong Impressions
of them as if we could compare and assort them in a
syllogism. We often love or hate at first sight; and
indeed, in general, dislike or approve by some secret
reference to these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principles</span></em>; and we judge even of
conduct, not from any idea of abstract good or evil in
the nature of actions, but by referring those actions
to a supposed original character in the man himself. I
do not mean that we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">talk</span></em> thus; we could not indeed,
if we would, explain ourselves in detail on this head;
we can neither account for Impressions and passions,
nor communicate them to others by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">words</span></em>: Tones and
looks will sometimes convey the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passion</span></em> strangely, but
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Impression</span></em> is incommunicable. The same causes
may produce it indeed at the same time in many, but
it is the separate possession of each, and not in its
nature transferable: It is an imperfect sort of instinct,
and proportionably dumb.—We might indeed, if we
chose it, candidly confess to one another that we are
greatly swayed by these feelings, and are by no means
so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rational</span></em> in all points as we could wish; but this would
be a betraying of the interests of that high faculty, the
Understanding, which we so value ourselves upon, and
which we more peculiarly call our own. This, we think,
must not be; and so we huddle up the matter, concealing
it as much as possible, both from ourselves and others.
In Books indeed, wherein character, motive, and action,
are all alike subjected to the Understanding, it is generally
a very clear case; and we make decisions compounded
of them all: And thus we are willing to approve of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Candide</span></span>, tho' he kills my Lord the Inquisitor, and runs
thro' the body the Baron of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thunder-ten-tronckh</span></span>, the son
of his patron, and the brother of his beloved <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cunégonde</span></span>:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But in real life, I believe, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">my Lords the Judges</span></span> would be
apt to inform the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gentlemen of the
Jury</span></span> that my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lord the
Inquisitor</span></span> was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ill killed</span></em>;
as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Candide</span></span> did not proceed on
the urgency of the moment, but on the speculation only
of future evil. And indeed this clear perception, in
Novels and Plays, of the union of character and action
not seen in nature, is the principal defect of such compositions,
and what renders them but ill pictures of
human life, and wretched guides of conduct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if there was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one man</span></em> in the world who could make
a more perfect draught of real nature, and steal such
Impressions on his audience, without their special notice,
as should keep their hold in spite of any error of their
Understanding, and should thereupon venture to introduce
an apparent incongruity of character and action,
for ends which I shall presently endeavour to explain;
such an imitation would be worth our nicest curiosity
and attention. But in such a case as this, the reader
might expect that he should find us all talking the
language of the Understanding only; that is, censuring
the action with very little conscientious investigation
even of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>; and transferring the censure, in every odious
colour, to the actor himself; how much soever our hearts
and affections might secretly revolt: For as to the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Impression</span></em>, we have already observed that it has no
tongue; nor is its operation and influence likely to be
made the subject of conference and communication.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Courage</span></em> only of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> that we
think these observations will apply: No part whatever of his
character seems to be fully settled in our minds; at least
there is something strangely incongruous in our discourse
and affections concerning him. We all like <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Jack</span></span>;
yet, by some strange perverse fate, we all abuse him, and
deny him the possession of any one single good or
respectable quality. There is something extraordinary
in this: It must be a strange art in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> which
can draw our liking and good will towards so offensive
an object. He has wit, it will be said; chearfulness and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
humour of the most characteristic and captivating sort.
And is this enough? Is the humour and gaiety of vice
so very captivating? Is the wit, characteristic of baseness
and every ill quality, capable of attaching the heart and
winning the affections? Or does not the apparency of
such humour, and the flashes of such wit, by more
strongly disclosing the deformity of character, but the
more effectually excite our hatred and contempt of the
man? And yet this is not our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feeling</span></em> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s
character. When he has ceased to amuse us, we find
no emotions of disgust; we can scarcely forgive the
ingratitude of the Prince in the new-born virtue of the
King, and we curse the severity of that poetic justice
which consigns our old good-natured companion to the
custody of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">warden</span></em>, and the dishonours of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fleet</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am willing, however, to admit that if a Dramatic
writer will but preserve to any character the qualities
of a strong mind, particularly Courage and ability, that
it will be afterwards no very difficult task (as I may
have occasion to explain) to discharge that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disgust</span></em> which
arises from vicious manners; and even to attach us (if
such character should contain any quality productive of
chearfulness and laughter) to the cause and subject of
our mirth with some degree of affection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the question which I am to consider is of a very
different nature: It is a question of fact, and concerning
a quality which forms the basis of every respectable
character; a quality which is the very essence of a
Military man; and which is held up to us, in almost
every Comic incident of the Play, as the subject of our
observation. It is strange then that it should now be
a question, whether <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is or is not a man of Courage;
and whether we do in fact contemn him for the want, or
respect him for the possession of that quality: And yet
I believe the reader will find that he has by no means
decided this question, even for himself.—If then it should
turn out that this difficulty has arisen out of the Art of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, who has contrived to make secret Impressions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon us of Courage, and to preserve those Impressions in
favour of a character which was to be held up for sport
and laughter on account of actions of apparent Cowardice
and dishonour, we shall have less occasion to wonder,
as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> is a Name which contains All of Dramatic
artifice and genius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If in this place the reader shall peevishly and prematurely
object that the observations and distinctions I
have laboured to establish are wholly unapplicable; he
being himself unconscious of ever having received any
such Impression; what can be done in so nice a case,
but to refer him to the following pages; by the number
of which he may judge how very much I respect his
objection, and by the variety of those proofs which I
shall employ to induce him to part with it; and to
recognize in its stead certain feelings, concealed and
covered over perhaps, but not erazed, by time, reasoning,
and authority?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the mean while, it may not perhaps be easy for
him to resolve how it comes about, that, whilst we look
upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> as a character of the like nature with that
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parolles</span></span> or of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bobadil</span></span>, we should preserve for him a
great degree of respect and good-will, and yet feel the
highest disdain and contempt of the others, tho' they
are all involved in similar situations. The reader, I
believe, would wonder extremely to find either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parolles</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bobadil</span></span> possess himself in danger: What then can
be the cause that we are not at all surprized at the gaiety
and ease of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> under the most trying circumstances;
and that we never think of charging <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> with
departing, on this account, from the truth and coherence
of character? Perhaps, after all, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> character of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> may be different from his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apparent</span></em> one; and
possibly this difference between reality and appearance,
whilst it accounts at once for our liking and our censure,
may be the true point of humour in the character, and
the source of all our laughter and delight. We may
chance to find, if we will but examine a little into the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature of those circumstances which have accidentally
involved him, that he was intended to be drawn as
a character of much Natural courage and resolution;
and be obliged thereupon to repeal those decisions which
may have been made upon the credit of some general
tho' unapplicable propositions; the common source of
error in other and higher matters. A little reflection
may perhaps bring us round again to the point of our
departure, and unite our Understandings to our instinct.—Let
us then for a moment <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspend</span></em> at least our decisions,
and candidly and coolly inquire if Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaff</span></span> be,
indeed, what he has so often been called by critic and
commentator, male and female,—a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Constitutional Coward</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will scarcely be possible to consider the Courage
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> as wholly detached from his other qualities:
But I write not professedly of any part of his character,
but what is included under the term, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Courage</span></span>; however,
I may incidentally throw some lights on the whole.—The
reader will not need to be told that this Inquiry will resolve
itself of course into a Critique on the genius, the arts,
and the conduct of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>:
For what is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, what
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lear</span></span>, what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Othello</span></span>, but different modifications
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s thought? It is true that this Inquiry
is narrowed almost to a single point: But general criticism
is as uninstructive as it is easy: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> deserves
to be considered in detail;—a task hitherto unattempted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be proper, in the first place, to take a short
view of all the parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Character, and then
proceed to discover, if we can, what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Impressions</span></em>, as to
Courage or Cowardice, he had made on the persons
of the Drama: After which we will examine, in course,
such evidence, either of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">persons</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facts</span></em>, as are relative
to the matter; and account as we may for those appearances
which seem to have led to the opinion of his
Constitutional Cowardice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scene of the robbery, and the disgraces attending
it, which stand first in the Play, and introduce us to
the knowledge of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, I shall beg leave (as I think
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this scene to have been the source of much unreasonable
prejudice) to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reserve</span></em> till we are more fully acquainted with
the whole character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>; and I shall therefore hope
that the reader will not for a time advert to it, or to the
jests of the Prince or of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> in consequence of that unlucky
adventure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In drawing out the parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character, with
which I shall begin this Inquiry, I shall take the liberty
of putting Constitutional bravery into his composition;
but the reader will be pleased to consider what I shall
say in that respect as spoken hypothetically for the
present, to be retained, or discharged out of it, as he
shall finally determine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To me then it appears that the leading quality in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character, and that from which all the rest take
their colour, is a high degree of wit and humour, accompanied
with great natural vigour and alacrity of mind.
This quality, so accompanied, led him probably very early
into life, and made him highly acceptable to society; so
acceptable, as to make it seem unnecessary for him to
acquire any other virtue. Hence, perhaps, his continued
debaucheries and dissipations of every kind.—He seems,
by nature, to have had a mind free of malice or any
evil principle; but he never took the trouble of acquiring
any good one. He found himself esteemed and beloved
with all his faults; nay <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em> his faults, which were all
connected with humour, and for the most part grew
out of it. As he had, possibly, no vices but such as
he thought might be openly professed, so he appeared
more dissolute thro' ostentation. To the character of
wit and humour, to which all his other qualities seem
to have conformed themselves, he appears to have added
a very necessary support, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> of the profession of a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Soldier</span></em>. He had from nature, as I presume to say, a
spirit of boldness and enterprise; which in a Military
age, tho' employment was only occasional, kept him
always above contempt, secured him an honourable
reception among the Great, and suited best both his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
particular mode of humour and of vice. Thus living
continually in society, nay even in Taverns, and indulging
himself, and being indulged by others, in every
debauchery; drinking, whoring, gluttony, and ease;
assuming a liberty of fiction, necessary perhaps to his
wit, and often falling into falsity and lies, he seems to
have set, by degrees, all sober reputation at defiance;
and finding eternal resources in his wit, he borrows,
shifts, defrauds, and even robs, without dishonour.—Laughter
and approbation attend his greatest excesses;
and being governed visibly by no settled bad principle
or ill design, fun and humour account for and cover all.
By degrees, however, and thro' indulgence, he acquires
bad habits, becomes an humourist, grows enormously
corpulent, and falls into the infirmities of age; yet never
quits, all the time, one single levity or vice of youth,
or loses any of that chearfulness of mind which had
enabled him to pass thro' this course with ease to himself
and delight to others; and thus, at last, mixing youth
and age, enterprize and corpulency, wit and folly, poverty
and expence, title and buffoonery, innocence as to purpose,
and wickedness as to practice; neither incurring hatred
by bad principle, or contempt by Cowardice, yet involved
in circumstances productive of imputation in both; a
butt and a wit, a humourist and a man of humour,
a touchstone and a laughing stock, a jester and a jest,
has Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaff</span></span>, taken at that period of his life in
which we see him, become the most perfect Comic
character that perhaps ever was exhibited.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may not possibly be wholly amiss to remark in this
place, that if Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaff</span></span> had possessed any of that
Cardinal quality, Prudence, alike the guardian of virtue
and the protector of vice; that quality, from the possession
or the absence of which, the character and fate of
men in this life take, I think, their colour, and not from
real vice or virtue; if he had considered his wit not as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principal</span></em> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accessary</span></em> only; as the instrument of power,
and not as power itself; if he had had much baseness to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hide, if he had had less of what may be called mellowness
or good humour, or less of health and spirit; if he
had spurred and rode the world with his wit, instead of
suffering the world, boys and all, to ride him;—he might,
without any other essential change, have been the admiration
and not the jest of mankind:—Or if he had lived
in our day, and instead of attaching himself to one Prince,
had renounced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> friendship and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> attachment, and had
let himself out as the ready instrument and Zany of every
successive Minister, he might possibly have acquired the
high honour of marking his shroud or decorating his
coffin with the living rays of an Irish at least, if not
a British Coronet: Instead of which, tho' enforcing
laughter from every disposition, he appears, now, as
such a character which every wise man will pity and
avoid, every knave will censure, and every fool will fear:
And accordingly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, ever true to nature, has
made <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harry</span></span> desert,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> censure him:—He dies
where he lived, in a Tavern, broken-hearted, without a
friend; and his final exit is given up to the derision
of fools. Nor has his misfortunes ended here; the
scandal arising from the misapplication of his wit and
talents seems immortal. He has met with as little justice
or mercy from his final judges the critics, as from his
companions of the Drama. With our cheeks still red
with laughter, we ungratefully as unjustly censure him
as a coward by nature, and a rascal upon principle:
Tho', if this were so, it might be hoped, for our own
credit, that we should behold him rather with disgust
and disapprobation than with pleasure and delight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to remember our question—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Is Falstaff a constitutional
coward?</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With respect to every infirmity, except that of
Cowardice, we must take him as at the period in which
he is represented to us. If we see him dissipated, fat,—it
is enough;—we have nothing to do with his youth,
when he might perhaps have been modest, chaste,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and not an Eagle's talon in the waist</span></em>.”</span>
But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Constitutional
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
Courage</span></span> extends to a man's whole life, makes a part of
his nature, and is not to be taken up or deserted like
a mere Moral quality. It is true, there is a Courage
founded upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principle</span></em>, or rather a principle independent
of Courage, which will sometimes operate in spite of
nature; a principle which prefers death to shame, but
which always refers itself, in conformity to its own nature,
to the prevailing modes of honour, and the fashions of
the age.—But Natural courage is another thing: It is
independent of opinion; It adapts itself to occasions,
preserves itself under every shape, and can avail itself
of flight as well as of action.—In the last war, some
Indians of America perceiving a line of Highlanders to
keep their station under every disadvantage, and under a
fire which they could not effectually return, were so
miserably mistaken in our points of honour as to conjecture,
from observation on the habit and stability of
those troops, that they were indeed the women of England,
who wanted courage to run away.—That Courage
which is founded in nature and constitution, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
as I presume to say, possessed;—but I am ready to
allow that the principle already mentioned, so far as
it refers to reputation only, began with every other Moral
quality to lose its hold on him in his old age; that is,
at the time of life in which he is represented to us;
a period, as it should seem, approaching to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventy</span></em>.—The
truth is that he had drollery enough to support
himself in credit without the point of honour, and had
address enough to make even the preservation of his
life a point of drollery. The reader knows I allude,
tho' something prematurely, to his fictitious death in the
battle of Shrewsbury. This incident is generally construed
to the disadvantage of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>: It is a transaction
which bears the external marks of Cowardice: It is also
aggravated to the spectators by the idle tricks of the
Player, who practises on this occasion all the attitudes
and wild apprehensions of fear; more ambitious, as it
should seem, of representing a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Caliban</span></span> than a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or indeed rather a poor unwieldy miserable Tortoise than
either.—The painful Comedian lies spread out on his
belly, and not only covers himself all over with his robe
as with a shell, but forms a kind of round Tortoise-back
by I know not what stuffing or contrivance; in addition
to which, he alternately lifts up, and depresses, and
dodges his head, and looks to the one side and to the
other, so much with the piteous aspect of that animal,
that one would not be sorry to see the ambitious imitator
calipashed in his robe, and served up for the entertainment
of the gallery.—There is no hint for this mummery
in the Play: Whatever there may be of dishonour in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s conduct, he neither does or says any thing on
this occasion which indicates terror or disorder of mind:
On the contrary, this very act is a proof of his having
all his wits about him, and is a stratagem, such as it is,
not improper for a buffoon, whose fate would be singularly
hard, if he should not be allowed to avail himself of his
Character when it might serve him in most stead. We
must remember, in extenuation, that the executive, the
destroying hand of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Douglas</span></span>
was over him: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It was time
to counterfeit, or that hot termagant Scot had paid him scot
and lot too.</span></span>”</span> He had but one choice; he was obliged
to pass thro' the ceremony of dying either in jest or
in earnest; and we shall not be surprized at the event,
when we remember his propensities to the former.—Life
(and especially the life of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>) might be a jest;
but he could see no joke whatever in dying: To be
chopfallen was, with him, to lose both life and character
together: He saw the point of honour, as well as every
thing else, in ridiculous lights, and began to renounce
its tyranny.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I am too much in advance, and must retreat for
more advantage. I should not forget how much opinion
is against me, and that I am to make my way by the
mere force and weight of evidence; without which I
must not hope to possess myself of the reader: No
address, no insinuation will avail. To this evidence,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then, I now resort. The Courage of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is my
Theme: And no passage will I spare from which any
thing can be inferred as relative to this point. It would
be as vain as injudicious to attempt concealment: How
could I escape detection? The Play is in every one's
memory, and a single passage remembered in detection
would tell, in the mind of the partial observer, for fifty
times its real weight. Indeed this argument would be
void of all excuse if it declined any difficulty; if it did
not meet, if it did not challenge opposition. Every
passage then shall be produced from which, in my opinion,
any inference, favourable or unfavourable, has or can
be drawn;—but not methodically, not formally, as texts
for comment, but as chance or convenience shall lead
the way; but in what shape soever, they shall be always
distinguishingly marked for notice. And so with that
attention to truth and candour which ought to accompany
even our lightest amusements I proceed to offer such
proof as the case will admit, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Courage</span></em> is a part of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Character</span></em>,
that it belonged to his constitution,
and was manifest in the conduct and practice of his whole
life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us then examine, as a source of very authentic
information, what Impressions <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir John Falstaff</span></span> had made
on the characters of the Drama; and in what estimation
he is supposed to stand with mankind in general as to
the point of Personal Courage. But the quotations we
make for this or other purposes, must, it is confessed,
be lightly touched, and no particular passage strongly
relied on, either in his favour or against him. Every
thing which he himself says, or is said of him, is so
phantastically discoloured by humour, or folly, or jest,
that we must for the most part look to the spirit rather
than the letter of what is uttered, and rely at last only
on a combination of the whole.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will begin then, if the reader pleases, by inquiring
what Impression the very Vulgar had taken of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>.
If it is not that of Cowardice, be it what else it may,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that of a man of violence, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a
Ruffian in years</span></span>, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harry</span></span>
calls him, or any thing else, it answers my purpose; how
insignificant soever the characters or incidents to be first
produced may otherwise appear;—for these Impressions
must have been taken either from personal knowledge
and observation; or, what will do better for my purpose,
from common fame. Altho' I must admit some part
of this evidence will appear so weak and trifling that it
certainly ought not to be produced but in proof Impression
only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hostess Quickly</span></span> employs two officers to arrest
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>: On the mention of his name, one of them
immediately observes, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that it may chance to cost some of
them their lives, for that he will
stab.</span></span>”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alas a day,</span></span>”</span> says
the hostess, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">take heed of him, he cares not what mischief he
doth; if his weapon be out, he will foin like any devil;
He will spare neither man, woman, or child.</span></span>”</span> Accordingly,
we find that when they lay hold on him he resists to
the utmost of his power, and calls upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bardolph</span></span>, whose
arms are at liberty, to draw. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Away, varlets, draw Bardolph,
cut me off the villain's head, throw the quean in the
kennel.</span></span>”</span> The officers cry, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a rescue, a rescue!</span></span> But the
Chief Justice comes in and the scuffle ceases. In another
scene, his wench <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Doll Tearsheet</span></span>
asks him <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">when he will
leave fighting ... and patch up his old body for
heaven.</span></span>”</span> This is occasioned by his drawing his rapier,
on great provocation, and driving <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pistol</span></span>, who is drawn
likewise, down stairs, and hurting him in the shoulder.
To drive <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pistol</span></span> was no great feat; nor do I mention
it as such; but upon this occasion it was necessary. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A
Rascal bragging slave,</span></span>”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the rogue fled from me
like quicksilver</span></span>”</span>: Expressions which, as they remember
the cowardice of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pistol</span></span>,
seem to prove that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> did
not value himself on the adventure. Even something
may be drawn from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Davy, Shallow</span></span>'s serving man, who
calls <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, in ignorant
admiration, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">man of war</span></span>.
I must observe here, and I beg the reader will notice
it, that there is not a single expression dropt by these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
people, or either of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s followers, from which may
be inferred the least suspicion of Cowardice in his
character; and this is I think such an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">implied negation</span></em>
as deserves considerable weight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to go a little higher, if, indeed, to consider
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>'s opinion be to go
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">higher</span></em>: It is from him, however,
that we get the earliest account of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>. He
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">remembers him a Page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk</span></span>:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He broke,</span></span>”</span> says he,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schoggan's head at the Court-Gate
when he was but a crack thus high.</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>, throughout,
considers him as a great Leader and Soldier, and
relates this fact as an early indication only of his future
Prowess. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>, it is true, is a very ridiculous character;
but he picked up these Impressions somewhere; and he
picked up none of a contrary tendency.—I want at
present only to prove that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> stood well in the
report of common fame as to this point; and he was now
near seventy years of age, and had passed in a Military
line thro' the active part of his life. At this period
common fame may be well considered as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seal</span></em> of
his character; a seal which ought not perhaps to be
broke open on the evidence of any future transaction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to proceed. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lord Bardolph</span></span> was a man of the
world, and of sense and observation. He informs <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Northumberland</span></span>,
erroneously indeed, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Percy</span></span> had beaten the
King at Shrewsbury. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The King,</span></span>”</span> according to him,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was wounded; the Prince of Wales and the two Blunts
slain, certain Nobles</span></span>, whom he names, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">had escaped by
flight, and the Brawn Sir John Falstaff was taken prisoner.</span></span>”</span>
But how came <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> into this list? Common fame had
put him there. He is singularly obliged to Common
fame.—But if he had not been a Soldier of repute, if
he had not been brave as well as fat, if he had been
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mere brawn</span></em>, it would have been more germane to the
matter if this lord had put him down among the baggage
or the provender. The fact seems to be that there is
a real consequence about Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaff</span></span> which is not
brought forward: We see him only in his familiar hours;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we enter the tavern with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hal</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>; we join in the
laugh and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">take a pride to gird at him</span></span>: But there may be
a great deal of truth in what he himself writes to the
Prince, that tho' he be <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jack Falstaff with his Familiars,
he is </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Sir John</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> with the rest of Europe.</span></span>”</span> It has been
remarked, and very truly I believe, that no man is a
hero in the eye of his valet-de-chambre; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thus</span></em> it is,
we are witnesses only of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s weakness and
buffoonery; our acquaintance is with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jack Falstaff</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plump Jack</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir John Paunch</span></span>; but if we would
look for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir John Falstaff</span></span>, we
must put on, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bunyan</span></span>
would have expressed it, the spectacles of observation.
With respect, for instance, to his Military command at
Shrewsbury, nothing appears on the surface but the
Prince's familiarly saying, in the tone usually assumed
when speaking of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I will procure this fat rogue
a Charge of foot</span></span>”</span>; and in another place, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I will procure
thee Jack a Charge of foot; meet me to-morrow in the
Temple Hall.</span></span>”</span> Indeed we might venture to infer from
this, that a Prince of so great ability, whose wildness was
only external and assumed, would not have procured, in
so nice and critical a conjuncture, a Charge of foot for a
known Coward. But there was more it seems in the
case: We now find from this report, to which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lord
Bardolph</span></span> had given full credit, that the world had its
eye upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> as an officer of merit, whom it expected
to find in the field, and whose fate in the battle was an
object of Public concern: His life was, it seems, very
material indeed; a thread of so much dependence, that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fiction</span></em>, weaving the fates of Princes, did not think it
unworthy, how coarse soever, of being made a part of
the tissue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall next produce the evidence of the Chief
Justice of England. He inquires of his attendant, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">if
the man who was then passing him was </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Falstaff</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">; he who
was in question for the robbery.</span></span>”</span> The attendant answers
affirmatively, but reminds his lord <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that he had since done
good service at Shrewsbury</span></span>”</span>; and the Chief Justice, on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this occasion, rating him for his debaucheries, tells him
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that his day's service at Shrewsbury had gilded over his
night's exploit at Gads Hill.</span></span>”</span> This is surely more than
Common fame: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Chief Justice</span></span> must have known his
whole character taken together, and must have received
the most authentic information, and in the truest colours,
of his behaviour in that action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, perhaps, after all, the Military men may be
esteemed the best judges in points of this nature. Let
us hear then <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coleville</span></span> of
the dale, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a Soldier, in degree a
Knight, a famous rebel, and</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">whose betters, had they been
ruled by him, would have sold themselves dearer</span></span>”</span>: A
man who is of consequence enough to be guarded by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Blunt</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">led
to present execution</span></span>. This man yields himself
up even to the very Name and Reputation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I think</span></span>,”</span> says he,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that
thought yield me.</span></span>”</span> But this is but one only among
the men of the sword; and they shall be produced then
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dozens</span></em>, if that will satisfy. Upon the return of the
King and Prince Henry from Wales, the Prince seeks
out and finds <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> debauching in a tavern; where
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peto</span></span> presently brings an account of ill news from the
North; and adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that as he came along he met or overtook
a dozen Captains, bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the
taverns, and asking every one for
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Sir John Falstaff</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">.</span></span>”</span> He is
followed by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bardolph</span></span>, who informs
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He must
away to the Court immediately; a dozen Captains stay at
door for him.</span></span>”</span> Here is Military evidence in abundance,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Court evidence</span></em> too; for what are we to infer from
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s being sent for to Court on this ill news, but that
his opinion was to be asked, as a Military man of skill and
experience, concerning the defences necessary to be taken.
Nor is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> content, here, with leaving us to gather
up <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">better
character</span></em> from inference and deduction:
He comments on the fact by making <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> observe that
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Men of merit are sought after: The undeserver may sleep
when the man of action is called on.</span></span>”</span> I do not wish
to draw <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character out of his own mouth; but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this observation refers to the fact, and is founded in
reason. Nor ought we to reject what in another place
he says to the Chief Justice, as it is in the nature of
an appeal to his knowledge. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">There is not a dangerous
action</span></span>,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">can peep out his head but I am thrust
upon it.</span></span>”</span> The Chief Justice seems by his answer to
admit the fact. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Well, be honest, be honest, and heaven
bless your expedition.</span></span>”</span> But the whole passage may
deserve transcribing.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> indulges himself here in
humourous exaggeration;—these
passages are not meant to be taken, nor
are we to suppose that they were taken, literally;—but if
there was not a ground of truth, if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> had not had
such a degree of Military reputation as was capable of
being thus humourously amplified and exaggerated, the
whole dialogue would have been highly preposterous and
absurd, and the acquiescing answer of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lord Chief
Justice</span></span> singularly improper.—But upon the supposition of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s being considered, upon the whole, as a good and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gallant Officer, the answer is just, and corresponds with
the acknowledgment which had a little before been made,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that his days service at Shrewsbury had gilded over his
night's exploit at Gads Hill.—You may thank the unquiet
time,</span></span>”</span> says the Chief Justice, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for your quiet o'erposting of
that action</span></span>”</span>; agreeing with what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> says in another
place;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Well, God be thanked for these Rebels, they offend
none but the virtuous; I laud them, I praise them.</span></span>”</span>—Whether
this be said in the true spirit of a Soldier or
not, I do not determine; it is surely not in that of a mere
Coward and Poltroon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be needless to shew, which might be done from
a variety of particulars, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was known and had
consideration at Court. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span> cultivates him in the
idea that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a friend at Court is better than a penny in purse</span></span>:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Westmorland</span></span> speaks to him in the tone of an equal: Upon
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s telling him that he thought his lordship had
been already at Shrewsbury, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Westmorland</span></span>
replies,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Faith
Sir John, 'tis more than time that I were there, and you too;
the King I can tell you looks for us all; we must away all
to night.</span></span>”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tut,</span></span>”</span>
says Falstaff, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">never fear me, I am as
vigilant as a cat to steal cream.</span></span>”</span>—He desires, in another
place, of my lord John of Lancaster, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that when he goes
to Court, he may stand in his good report.</span></span>”</span> His intercourse
and correspondence with both these lords seem
easy and familiar. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Go,</span></span>”</span>
says he to the page, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bear this
to my Lord of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earl
of Westmorland, and this</span></span> (for he extended himself on all
sides) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to old Mrs. Ursula</span></span>,”</span> whom, it seems, the rogue
ought to have married many years before.—But these
intimations are needless: We see him ourselves in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Royal Presence</span></span>; where, certainly, his buffooneries never
brought him; never was the Prince of a character to
commit so high an indecorum, as to thrust, upon a solemn
occasion, a mere Tavern companion into his father's
Presence, especially in a moment when he himself deserts
his looser character, and takes up that of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a Prince indeed</span></span>.—In
a very important scene, where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Worcester</span></span> is expected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with proposals from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Percy</span></span>, and wherein he is received, is
treated with, and carries back offers of accommodation
from the King, the King's attendants upon the occasion
are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, the Earl of
Westmorland, Sir Walter Blunt, and Sir John Falstaff</span></span>.—What
shall be said to this? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is not surely introduced
here in vicious indulgence to a mob audience;—he
utters but one word, a buffoon one indeed, but aside, and
to the Prince only. Nothing, it should seem, is wanting,
if decorum would here have permitted, but that he
should have spoken one sober sentence in the Presence
(which yet we are to suppose him ready and able to
do if occasion should have required; or his wit was given
him to little purpose) and Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaff</span></span> might be
allowed to pass for an established Courtier and counsellor
of state. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">If I do grow great,</span></span>”</span>
says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I'll grow less,
purge and leave sack, and live as a nobleman should do.</span></span>”</span>
Nobility did not then appear to him at an unmeasurable
distance; it was, it seems, in his idea, the very next link
in the chain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to return. I would now demand what could bring
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> into the Royal Presence upon such an occasion, or
justify the Prince's so public acknowledgment of him,
but an established fame and reputation of Military merit?
In short, just the like merit as brought Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Walter Blunt</span></span>
into the same circumstances of honour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it may be objected that his introduction into this
scene is a piece of indecorum in the author. But upon
what ground are we to suppose this? Upon the ground
of his being a notorious Coward? Why, this is the very
point in question, and cannot be granted: Even the direct
contrary I have affirmed, and am endeavouring to support.
But if it be supposed upon any other ground, it does not
concern me; I have nothing to do with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s indecorums
in general. That there are indecorums in the
Play I have no doubt: The indecent treatment of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Percy</span></span>'s
dead body is the greatest;—the familiarity of the significant,
rude, and even ill disposed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> with the Prince,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is another;—but the admission of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> into the Royal
Presence (supposing, which I have a right to suppose, that
his Military character was unimpeached) does not seem to
be in any respect among the number. In camps there is
but one virtue and one vice; Military merit swallows up
or covers all. But, after all, what have we to do with
indecorums? Indecorums respect the propriety or impropriety
of exhibiting certain actions;—not their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">falshood</span></em> when exhibited. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> stands to us in
the place of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>: If we desert this principle, we
cut the turf from under us; I may then object to the
robbery and other passages as indecorums, and as contrary
to the truth of character. In short we may rend and tear
the Play to pieces, and every man carry off what sentences
he likes best.—But why this inveterate malice against
poor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>? He has faults enough in conscience without
loading him with the infamy of Cowardice; a charge,
which, if true, would, if I am not greatly mistaken, spoil
all our mirth.—But of that hereafter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems to me that, in our hasty judgment of some
particular transactions, we forget the circumstances and
condition of his whole life and character, which yet deserve
our very particular attention. The author, it is true, has
thrown the most advantageous of these circumstances
into the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">back ground</span></em>, as it were, and has brought nothing
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">out of the canvass</span></em> but his follies and buffoonery. We
discover, however, that in a very early period of his life he
was familiar with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gaunt</span></span>; which could hardly be,
unless he had possessed much personal gallantry and
accomplishment, and had derived his birth from a distinguished
at least, if not from a Noble family.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may seem very extravagant to insist upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s
birth as a ground from which, by any inference, Personal
courage may be derived, especially after having acknowledged
that he seemed to have deserted those points of
honour which are more peculiarly the accompanyments
of rank. But it may be observed that in the Feudal ages
rank and wealth were not only connected with the point
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of honour, but with personal strength and natural courage.
It is observable that Courage is a quality which is at least
as transmissible to one's posterity as features and complexion.
In these periods men acquired and maintained
their rank and possessions by personal prowess and
gallantry; and their marriage alliances were made, of
course, in families of the same character: And from
hence, and from the exercises of their youth, we must
account for the distinguished force and bravery of our
antient Barons. It is not therefore beside my purpose to
inquire what hints of the origin and birth of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> may have dropped in different parts of the
Play; for tho' we may be disposed to allow that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
in his old age might, under particular influences, desert
the point of honour, we cannot give up that unalienable
possession of Courage, which might have been derived to
him from a noble or distinguished stock.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it may be said that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was in truth the child of
invention only, and that a reference to the Feudal accidents
of birth serves only to confound fiction with reality: Not
altogether so. If the ideas of courage and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">birth</span></em> were
strongly associated in the days of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, then would
the assignment of high birth to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> carry, and be
intended to carry along with it, to the minds of the
audience the associated idea of Courage, if nothing should
be specially interposed to dissolve the connection;—and
the question is as concerning this intention, and this effect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall proceed yet farther to make a few very minute
observations of the same nature: But if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> meant
sometimes rather to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impress</span></em> than explain, no circumstances
calculated to this end, either directly or by association, are
too minute for notice. But however this may be, a more
conciliating reason still remains: The argument itself, like
the tales of our Novelists, is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vehicle</span></em> only; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theirs</span></em>, as they
profess, of moral instruction; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mine</span></em> of critical amusement.
The vindication of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Courage deserves
not for its own sake the least sober discussion; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is
the word only, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> is
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theme</span></em>: And if thro' this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
channel I can furnish no irrational amusement, the reader
will not, perhaps, every where expect from me the strict
severity of logical investigation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, then, it may be observed, was introduced into
the world,—(at least we are told so) by
the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oldcastle</span></span>.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>
This was assigning him an origin of nobility; but
the family of that name disclaiming any kindred with his
vices, he was thereupon, as it is said, ingrafted into
another stock<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>
scarcely less distinguished, tho' fallen into
indelible disgraces; and by this means he has been made,
if the conjectures of certain critics are well founded, the
Dramatic successor, tho', having respect to chronology,
the natural <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">proavus</span></span> of
another Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span>, who was no less
than a Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, but
a name for ever dishonoured by a frequent exposure in
that Drum-and-trumpet Thing called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The first part of
Henry</span></span> VI., written doubtless, or rather exhibited, long
before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> was born,<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> tho' afterwards repaired, I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
think, and furbished up by him with here and there a
little sentiment and diction. This family, if any branch
of it remained in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s time, might have been
proud of their Dramatic ally, if indeed they could have
any fair pretence to claim as such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em> whom
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>,
perhaps in contempt of Cowardice, wrote <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, not
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fastolfe</span></span>, the true Historic name of the Gartered Craven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the age of Henry IV. a Family crest and arms were
authentic proofs of gentility; and this proof, among
others, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has furnished
us with: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> always
carried about him, it seems, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a Seal ring of his Grandfather's,
worth</span></span>, as he says, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">forty marks</span></span>: The Prince indeed affirms,
but not seriously I think, that this ring was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">copper</span></span>. As
to the existence of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bonds</span></span>, which were I suppose the
negotiable securities or paper-money of the time, and
which he pretended to have lost, I have nothing to say;
but the ring, I believe, was really gold; tho' probably a
little too much alloyed with baser metal. But this
is not the point: The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arms</span></em> were doubtless genuine;
they were borne by his Grandfather, and are proofs
of an antient gentility; a gentility doubtless, in former
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
periods, connected with wealth and possessions, tho'
the gold of the family might have been transmuting
by degrees, and perhaps, in the hands of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
converted into little better than copper. This observation
is made on the supposition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s being
considered as the head of the family, which I think however
he ought not to be. It appears rather as if he ought
to be taken in the light of a cadet or younger brother;
which the familiar appellation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the only one
(as he says) given him by his brothers and sisters,”</span>
seems to indicate. Be this as it may, we find he is able,
in spite of dissipation, to keep up a certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">state</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dignity</span></em>
of appearance; retaining no less than four, if not five,
followers or men servants in his train. He appears also
to have had apartments in town, and, by his invitations of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Gower</span></span> to dinner and to supper, a regular table:
And one may infer farther from the Prince's question, on
his return from Wales, to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bardolph</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Is your master</span></span> here
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in London</span></span>,”</span> that he had likewise a house in the country.
Slight proofs it must be confessed, yet the inferences are
so probable, so buoyant, in their own nature, that they
may well rest on them. That he did not lodge at the
Tavern is clear from the circumstances of the arrest.
These various occasions of expence,—servants, taverns,
houses, and whores,—necessarily imply that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> must
have had some funds which are not brought immediately
under our notice. That these funds were not however
adequate to his style of living is plain: Perhaps his train
may be considered only as incumbrances, which the pride
of family and the habit of former opulence might have
brought upon his present poverty: I do not mean absolute
poverty, but call it so as relative to his expence. To have
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">but seven groats and two-pence in his purse</span></span>”</span> and a page to
bear it, is truly ridiculous; and it is for that reason we
become so familiar with its contents, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He can find</span></span>,”</span> he
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">no remedy for this consumption of the purse, borrowing
does but linger and linger it out; but the disease is incurable</span></span>.”</span>
It might well be deemed so in his course of dissipation:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But I shall presently suggest one source at least of his
supply much more constant and honourable than that of
borrowing. But the condition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> as to opulence
or poverty is not very material to my purpose: It is
enough if his birth was distinguished, and his youth noted
for gallantry and accomplishments. To the first I have
spoken, and as for the latter we shall not be at a loss
when we remember that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he was in his youth a page to
Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk</span></span>”</span>; a situation at that
time sought for by young men of the best families and
first fortune. The house of every great noble was at
that period a kind of Military school; and it is probable
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was singularly
adroit at his exercises: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He
broke Schoggan's head</span></span>,”</span> (some boisterous fencer I suppose)
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">when he was but a crack thus
high</span></span>.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span> remembers
him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as notedly skilful at backsword</span></span>; and he was at that
period, according to his own humourous account, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scarcely
an eagle's talon in the waist, and could have crept thro' an
alderman's thumb ring</span></span>.”</span> Even at the age at which he
is exhibited to us, we find him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">foundering</span></span>, as he calls
it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nine score and odd miles</span></span>, with wonderful expedition, to
join the army of Prince <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>; and declaring,
after the surrender of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coleville</span></span>,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">had he but a belly of
any indifferency, he were simply the most active fellow in
Europe</span></span>.”</span> Nor ought we here to pass over his Knighthood
without notice. It was, I grant, intended by the
author as a dignity which, like his Courage and his wit,
was to be debased; his knighthood by low situations, his
Courage by circumstances and imputations of cowardice,
and his wit by buffoonery. But how are we to suppose
this honour was acquired? By that very Courage, it
should seem, which we so obstinately deny him. It
was not certainly given him, like a modern City
Knighthood, for his wealth or gravity: It was in these
days a Military honour, and an authentic badge of
Military merit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was not only a Military Knight, he
possess'd an honourable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pension</span></em> into the bargain; the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reward as well as retainer of service, and which seems
(besides the favours perhaps of Mrs. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ursula</span></span>) to be the
principal and only solid support of his present expences.
But let us refer to the passage. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A pox of this gout, or a
gout of this pox; for one or the other plays the rogue with my
great toe: It is no matter if I do halt, I have the wars for
my colour, and my pension shall seem the more reasonable.</span></span>”</span>
The mention <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> here makes of a pension, has I
believe been generally construed to refer rather to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hope</span></em>
than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possession</span></em>, yet I know not why: For the possessive
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">my</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my pension</span></em>,
(not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> pension) requires a different construction.
Is it that we cannot enjoy a wit till we have
stript him of every worldly advantage, and reduced him
below the level of our envy? It may be perhaps for this
reason among others that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has so obscured the
better parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> and stolen them secretly out of our
feelings, instead of opening them fairly to the notice of
our understandings. How carelessly, and thro' what bye-paths,
as it were, of casual inference, is this fact of a
pension introduced! And how has he associated it with
misfortune and infirmity! Yet I question, however, if,
in this one place, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Impression</span></em> which was intended be
well and effectually made. It must be left to the reader
to determine if, in that mass of things out of which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
is compounded, he ever considered a pension as any part
of the composition: A pension however he appears to
have had, one that halting could only seem to make more
reasonable, not more honourable. The inference arising
from the fact, I shall leave to the reader. It is surely a
circumstance highly advantageous to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> (I speak of
the pensions of former days), whether he be considered in
the light of a soldier or a gentleman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot foresee the temper of the reader, nor whether
he be content to go along with me in these kind of
observations. Some of the incidents which I have drawn
out of the Play may appear too minute, whilst yet they
refer to principles which may seem too general. Many
points require explanation; something should be said
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the nature of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s Dramatic
characters;<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> by
what arts they were formed, and wherein they differ from
those of other writers; something likewise more professedly
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> himself, and of the peculiar
character of his genius. After such a review we may
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not perhaps think any consideration arising out of the
Play, or out of general nature, either as too minute or
too extensive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> is, in truth, an author whose mimic
creation agrees in general so perfectly with that of
nature, that it is not only wonderful in the great, but
opens another scene of amazement to the discoveries of
the microscope. We have been charged indeed by a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Foreign writer with an overmuch admiring of this
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Barbarian</span></em>: Whether we have admired with knowledge,
or have blindly followed those feelings of affection which
we could not resist, I cannot tell; but certain it is, that
to the labours of his Editors he has not been overmuch
obliged. They are however for the most part of the first
rank in literary fame; but some of them had possessions
of their own in Parnassus, of an extent too great and
important to allow of a very diligent attention to the
interests of others; and among those Critics more professionally
so, the ablest and the best has unfortunately
looked more to the praise of ingenious than of just conjecture.
The character of his emendations are not so
much that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em>, as that, being in the extreme,
they are always <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Warburtonian</span></em>. Another has since undertaken
the custody of our author, whom he seems to
consider as a sort of wild Proteus or madman, and
accordingly knocks him down with the butt-end of his
critical staff, as often as he exceeds that line of sober
discretion, which this learned Editor appears to have
chalked out for him: Yet is this Editor notwithstanding
<span class="tei tei-q">“a man, take him for all in all,”</span> very highly respectable
for his genius and his learning. What however may be
chiefly complained of in these gentlemen is, that having
erected themselves into the condition, as it were, of
guardians and trustees of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, they have never
undertaken to discharge the disgraceful incumbrances of
some wretched productions which have long hung heavy
on his fame. Besides the evidence of taste, which indeed
is not communicable, there are yet other and more
general proofs that these incumbrances were not incurred
by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>: The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></em> sentences dispersed
thro' the imputed trash is, I think, of itself a decisive one. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Love's
Labour lost</span></span> contains a very conclusive one of another
kind; tho' the very last Editor has, I believe, in his
critical sagacity, suppressed the evidence, and withdrawn
the record.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet whatever may be the neglect of some, or the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
censure of others, there are those who firmly believe that
this wild, this uncultivated Barbarian has not yet obtained
one half of his fame; and who trust that some new
Stagyrite will arise, who instead of pecking at the surface
of things will enter into the inward soul of his compositions,
and expel, by the force of congenial feelings,
those foreign impurities which have stained and disgraced
his page. And as to those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spots</span></em> which will still remain,
they may perhaps become invisible to those who shall
seek them thro' the medium of his beauties, instead of
looking for those beauties, as is too frequently done, thro'
the smoke of some real or imputed obscurity. When the
hand of time shall have brushed off his present Editors
and Commentators, and when the very name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voltaire</span></span>,
and even the memory of the language in which he has
written, shall be no more, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apalachian</span></span> mountains, the
banks of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ohio</span></span>, and the
plains of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sciota</span></span> shall resound
with the accents of this Barbarian: In his native tongue
he shall roll the genuine passions of nature; nor shall the
griefs of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lear</span></span> be alleviated, or the charms and wit of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rosalind</span></span> be abated by time. There is indeed nothing
perishable about him, except that very learning which
he is said so much to want. He had not, it is true,
enough for the demands of the age in which he lived,
but he had perhaps too much for the reach of his genius,
and the interest of his fame. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Milton</span></span> and he will carry
the decayed remnants and fripperies of antient mythology
into more distant ages than they are by their own
force intitled to extend; and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metamorphoses</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ovid</span></span>, upheld by them, lay in a new claim to unmerited
immortality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> is a name so interesting, that it is excusable
to stop a moment, nay it would be indecent to pass him
without the tribute of some admiration. He differs
essentially from all other writers: Him we may profess
rather to feel than to understand; and it is safer to say,
on many occasions, that we are possessed by him, than
that we possess him. And no wonder;—He scatters the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seeds of things, the principles of character and action, with
so cunning a hand, yet with so careless an air, and, master
of our feelings, submits himself so little to our judgment,
that every thing seems superior. We discern not his
course, we see no connection of cause and effect, we are
rapt in ignorant admiration, and claim no kindred with his
abilities. All the incidents, all the parts, look like chance,
whilst we feel and are sensible that the whole is design.
His Characters not only act and speak in strict conformity
to nature, but in strict relation to us; just so much is
shewn as is requisite, just so much is impressed; he commands
every passage to our heads and to our hearts, and
moulds us as he pleases, and that with so much ease, that
he never betrays his own exertions. We see these Characters
act from the mingled motives of passion, reason,
interest, habit, and complection, in all their proportions,
when they are supposed to know it not themselves; and
we are made to acknowledge that their actions and sentiments
are, from those motives, the necessary result. He
at once blends and distinguishes every thing;—every thing
is complicated, every thing is plain. I restrain the further
expressions of my admiration lest they should not seem
applicable to man; but it is really astonishing that a mere
human being, a part of humanity only, should so perfectly
comprehend the whole; and that he should possess such
exquisite art, that whilst every woman and every child
shall feel the whole effect, his learned Editors and Commentators
should yet so very frequently mistake or seem
ignorant of the cause. A sceptre or a straw are in his
hands of equal efficacy; he needs no selection; he
converts every thing into excellence; nothing is too great,
nothing is too base. Is a character efficient like <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard</span></span>,
it is every thing we can wish: Is it otherwise, like <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>,
it is productive of equal admiration: Action produces one
mode of excellence, and inaction another: The Chronicle,
the Novel, or the Ballad; the king, or the beggar, the
hero, the madman, the sot, or the fool; it is all one;—nothing
is worse, nothing is better: The same genius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pervades and is equally admirable in all. Or, is a character
to be shewn in progressive change, and the events
of years comprized within the hour;—with what a Magic
hand does he prepare and scatter his spells! The Understanding
must, in the first place, be subdued; and lo!
how the rooted prejudices of the child spring up to
confound the man! The Weird sisters rise, and order
is extinguished. The laws of nature give way, and leave
nothing in our minds but wildness and horror. No pause
is allowed us for reflection: Horrid sentiment, furious
guilt and compunction, air-drawn daggers, murders,
ghosts, and inchantment, shake and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possess us wholly</span></em>. In
the mean time the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">process</span></em> is completed.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span> changes
under our eye, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the milk of human kindness is converted to
gall; he has supped full of horrors</span></span>, and his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May of life is
fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf</span></span>; whilst we, the fools of
amazement, are insensible to the shifting of place and the
lapse of time, and, till the curtain drops, never once wake
to the truth of things, or recognize the laws of existence.—On
such an occasion, a fellow, like <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rymer</span></span>, waking from
his trance, shall lift up his Constable's staff, and charge
this great Magician, this daring <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">practicer of arts inhibited</span></span>,
in the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>, to surrender;
whilst <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>
himself, disowning his wretched Officer, would fall prostrate
at his feet and acknowledge his supremacy.—O
supreme of Dramatic excellence! (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">might he say</span></span>) not to
me be imputed the insolence of fools. The bards of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greece</span></span> were confined within the narrow circle of the
Chorus, and hence they found themselves constrained to
practice, for the most part, the precision, and copy the
details of nature. I followed them, and knew not that a
larger circle might be drawn, and the Drama extended
to the whole reach of human genius. Convinced, I see
that a more compendious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> may be obtained; a
nature of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effects</span></em> only, to which neither the relations of
place, or continuity of time, are always essential. Nature,
condescending to the faculties and apprehensions of
man, has drawn through human life a regular chain of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
visible causes and effects: But Poetry delights in surprise,
conceals her steps, seizes at once upon the heart, and
obtains the Sublime of things without betraying the
rounds of her ascent: True Poesy is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magic</span></em>, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>;
an effect from causes hidden or unknown. To the
Magician I prescribed no laws; his law and his power
are one; his power is his law. Him, who neither
imitates, nor is within the reach of imitation, no precedent
can or ought to bind, no limits to contain. If his end is
obtained, who shall question his course? Means, whether
apparent or hidden, are justified in Poesy by success;
but then most perfect and most admirable when most
concealed.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> But whither am I going! This copious and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
delightful topic has drawn me far beyond my design; I
hasten back to my subject, and am guarded, for a time at
least, against any further temptation to digress.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was considering the dignity of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> so far as it
might seem connected with or productive of military
merit, and I have assigned him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reputation</span></em> at least, if not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fame</span></em>, noble connection, birth, attendants, title, and an
honourable pension; every one of them presumptive
proofs of Military merit, and motives of action. What
deduction is to be made on these articles, and why they
are so much obscured may, perhaps, hereafter appear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have now gone through the examination of all the
Persons of the Drama from whose mouths any thing can
be drawn relative to the Courage of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, excepting the
Prince and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>, whose evidence I have begged leave to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reserve</span></em>, and excepting a very severe censure passed on
him by Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>, which I shall presently
consider: But I must first observe that, setting aside the
jests of the Prince and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>,
and this censure of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>,
there is not one expression uttered by any character in the
Drama that can be construed into any impeachment of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Courage;—an
observation made before as respecting
some of the Witnesses;—it is now extended to
all: And though this silence be a negative proof only, it
cannot, in my opinion, under the circumstances of the
case, and whilst uncontradicted by facts, be too much
relied on. If <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> had been intended for the character
of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miles Gloriosus</span></span>, his behaviour ought and therefore
would have been commented upon by others. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seldom trusts to the apprehensions of his audience; his
characters interpret for one another continually, and when
we least suspect such artful and secret management:
The conduct of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> in this respect is admirable,
and I could point out a thousand passages which might
put to shame the advocates of a formal Chorus, and
prove that there is as little of necessity as grace in so
mechanic a contrivance.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> But I confine my censure of
the Chorus to its supposed use of comment and interpretation
only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is, indeed, so far from appearing to my eye in
the light of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miles Gloriosus</span></span>, that, in the best of my taste
and judgment, he does not discover, except in consequence
of the robbery, the least <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trait</span></em> of such a character.
All his boasting speeches are humour, mere humour, and
carefully spoken to persons who cannot misapprehend
them, who cannot be imposed on: They contain indeed,
for the most part, an unreasonable and imprudent ridicule
of himself, the usual subject of his good humoured merriment;
but in the company of ignorant people, such as
the Justices, or his own followers, he is remarkably
reserved, and does not hazard any thing, even in the way
of humour, that may be subject to mistake: Indeed he
no where seems to suspect that his character is open to
censure on this side, or that he needs the arts of
imposition.—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Turk
Gregory never did such deeds in arms as
I have done this day</span></span>”</span> is spoken, whilst he breathes from
action, to the Prince in a tone of jolly humour, and
contains nothing but a light ridicule of his own inactivity:
This is as far from real boasting as his saying before the
battle, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wou'd it were bed-time,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Hal</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, and all were well</span></span>,”</span> is
from meanness or depression. This articulated wish is not
the fearful outcry of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Coward</span></em>, but the frank and honest
breathing of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generous fellow</span></em>, who does not expect to be
seriously reproached with the character. Instead, indeed,
of deserving the name of a vain glorious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Coward</span></em>, his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
modesty perhaps on his head, and whimsical ridicule of
himself, have been a principal source of the imputation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to come to the very serious reproach thrown upon
him by that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cold blooded</span></span> boy, as he
calls him, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>
makes a solemn treaty of peace with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Archbishop
of York, Mowbray</span></span>, &amp;c. upon the faith of which they
disperse their troops; which is no sooner done than
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> arrests the Principals,
and pursues the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scattered
stray</span></span>: A transaction, by the bye, so singularly perfidious,
that I wish <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, for his own credit, had not
suffered it to pass under his pen without marking it with
the blackest strokes of Infamy.—During this transaction,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> arrives, joins in the pursuit,
and takes Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This may appear to many a very formidable passage.
It is spoken, as we may say, in the hearing of the army,
and by one intitled as it were by his station to decide
on military conduct; and if no punishment immediately
follows, the forbearance may be imputed to a regard for
the Prince of Wales, whose favour the delinquent was
known so unworthily to possess. But this reasoning will
by no means apply to the real circumstances of the case.
The effect of this passage will depend on the credit we
shall be inclined to give to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> for integrity and
candour, and still more upon the facts which are the
ground of this censure, and which are fairly offered by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> to our notice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will examine the evidence arising from both; and
to this end we must in the first place a little unfold the
character of this young Commander in chief;—from a review
of which we may more clearly discern the general
impulses and secret motives of his conduct: And this is a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proceeding which I think the peculiar character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s
Drama will very well justify.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are already well prepared what to think of this
young man:—We have just seen a very pretty manœuvre
of his in a matter of the highest moment, and have therefore
the less reason to be surprized if we find him
practising a more petty fraud with suitable skill and
address. He appears in truth to have been what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
calls him, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a cold, reserved, sober-blooded boy</span></span>; a politician, as
it should seem, by nature; bred up moreover in the
school of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bolingbroke</span></span> his father, and tutored to betray:
With sufficient courage and ability perhaps, but with too
much of the knave in his composition, and too little of
enthusiasm, ever to be a great and superior character.
That such a youth as this should, even from the propensities
of character alone, take any plausible occasion to
injure a frank unguarded man of wit and pleasure, will
not appear unnatural. But he had other inducements.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> had given very general scandal by his distinguished
wit and noted poverty, insomuch that a little cruelty and
injustice towards him was likely to pass, in the eye of
the grave and prudent part of mankind, as a very creditable
piece of fraud, and to be accounted to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> for
virtue and good service. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> had motives yet
more prevailing; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was a Favourite, without the
power which belongs to that character; and the tone of
the Court was strongly against him, as the misleader and
corrupter of the Prince; who was now at too great a
distance to afford him immediate countenance and protection.
A scratch then, between jest and earnest as it
were, something that would not too much offend the
prince, yet would leave behind a disgraceful scar upon
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, was very suitable to the temper and situation of
parties and affairs. With these observations in our
thought, let us return to the passage: It is plainly intended
for disgrace, but how artful, how cautious, how
insidious is the manner! It may pass for sheer pleasantry
and humour: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> assumes the familiar phrase and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">girding</span></em> tone of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harry</span></span>; and the gallows, as he
words it, appears to be in the most danger from an encounter with
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>.—With respect to the matter, 'tis a kind of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">miching malicho</span></span>; it means mischief indeed, but there is
not precision enough in it to intitle it to the appellation of
a formal charge, or to give to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> any certain and
determined ground of defence. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tardy tricks</span></span> may mean
not Cowardice but neglect only, though the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">manner</span></span> may
seem to carry the imputation to both.—The reply of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is exactly suited to
the qualities of the speech;—for
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> never wants ability, but conduct only. He
answers the general effect of this speech by a feeling and
serious complaint of injustice; he then goes on to apply
his defence to the vindication both of his diligence and
courage; but he deserts by degrees his serious tone, and
taking the handle of pleasantry which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> had held
forth to him, he is prudently content, as being sensible of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>'s high rank and station, to let the whole pass off
in buffoonery and humour. But the question is, however,
not concerning the adroitness and management of either
party: Our business is, after putting the credit of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> out of the question, to discover what there may
be of truth and of fact either in the charge of the one, or
the defence of the other. From this only, we shall be
able to draw our inferences with fairness and with
candour. The charge against <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is already in the
possession of the reader: The defence follows.—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fals. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I
never knew yet but that rebuke and check were the reward of
valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet?
Have I in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought?
I speeded hither within the very extremest inch of possibility.
I have foundered ninescore and odd posts</span></span> (deserting by
degrees his serious tone, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> of more address and
advantage), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and here, travel-tainted as I am, have I in my
pure and immaculate valour taken Sir John Coleville of the
dale, a most furious Knight and valorous enemy.</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s answer then is that he used all possible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
expedition to join the army; the not doing of which,
with an implication of Cowardice as the cause, is the
utmost extent of the charge against him; and to take off
this implication he refers to the evidence of a fact present
and manifest,—the surrender of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coleville</span></span>; in whose hearing
he speaks, and to whom therefore he is supposed to
appeal. Nothing then remains but that we should inquire
if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s answer was really
founded in truth; <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I
speeded hither</span></span>”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">within
the extremest inch of possibility</span></span>”</span>:
If it be so, he is justified: But I am afraid, for
we must not conceal any thing, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was really
detained too long by his debaucheries in London; at least,
if we take the Chief Justice's words very strictly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ch. Just. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">How now, Sir John? What are you brawling
here? Doth this become your </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Place</span></span></span><span style="font-style: italic">,
your </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Time</span></span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, your

You should have been well on your way to
York.</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here then seems to be a delay worthy perhaps of rebuke;
and if we could suppose <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> to mean nothing
more by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tardy tricks</span></span> than idleness and debauch, I should not
possibly think myself much concerned to vindicate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
from the charge; but the words imply, to my apprehension,
a designed and deliberate avoidance of danger.
Yet to the contrary of this we are furnished with very
full and complete evidence. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, the moment he
quits London, discovers the utmost eagerness and impatience
to join the army; he gives up his gluttony, his
mirth, and his ease. We see him take up in his passage
some recruits at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>'s house; and tho' he has
pecuniary views upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>, no inducement stops him;
he takes no refreshment, he cannot <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarry dinner</span></span>, he hurries
off; <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I will not</span></span>,”</span> says
he to the Justices, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">use many words
with you. Fare ye well, Gentlemen both; I thank ye, I
must a dozen miles to night.</span></span>”</span>—He misuses, it is true, at
this time the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King's Press damnably</span></span>; but that does not
concern me, at least not for the present; it belongs to
other parts of his character.—It appears then manifestly
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> meant to shew
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> as really using the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
utmost speed in his power; he arrives almost literally
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">within the extremest inch of possibility</span></span>;
and if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> had
not accelerated the event by a stroke of perfidy much
more subject to the imputation of Cowardice than the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Debauch</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
he would have been time enough to
have shared in the danger of a fair and honest decision.
But great men have, it seems, a privilege; <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that in the
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">General's</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> but a choleric word,
which in the </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Soldier were</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">
flat blasphemy.</span></span>”</span> Yet after all, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> did really come
time enough, as it appears, to join in the villainous
triumphs of the day, to take prisoner <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coleville of the dale,
a most furious Knight and valorous enemy</span></span>.—Let us look to
the fact. If this incident should be found to contain any
striking proof of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Courage and Military fame,
his defence against <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> will be stronger than the
reader has even a right to demand. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> encounters
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coleville</span></span> in the field, and, having demanded his name, is
ready to assail him; but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coleville</span></span> asks him if he is not
Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Falstaff</span></span>; thereby implying a purpose of surrender.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> will not so much as furnish him with a
pretence, and answers only, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he is as good a man</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Do you yield Sir, or shall
I sweat for you?</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I think</span></span>,”</span>
says Coleville, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that
thought yield me.</span></span>”</span> This fact, and the incidents with
which it is accompanied, speak loudly; it seems to have
been contrived by the author on purpose to take off a
rebuke so authoritatively made by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>. The fact
is set before our eyes to confute the censure: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>
himself seems to give up his charge, tho' not his ill will;
for upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s asking leave to pass through Glostershire,
and artfully desiring that, upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>'s return to
Court, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he might stand well in his report, Lancaster</span></span> seems in
his answer to mingle malice and acquittal. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fare ye well,
Falstaff, I in my condition shall better speak of you than you
deserve.</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I would</span></span>,”</span> says
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, who is left behind in
the scene, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You had but the wit; 'twere better than your
Dukedom.</span></span>”</span> He continues on the stage some time
chewing the cud of dishonour, which, with all his facility,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he cannot well swallow. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Good faith</span></span>”</span> says he, accounting
to himself as well as he could for the injurious
conduct of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this sober-blooded boy does not love
me.</span></span>”</span> This he might well believe. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A man</span></span>,”</span> says he,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot make him laugh; there's none of these demure boys come
to any proof; but that's no marvel, they drink no
sack.</span></span>”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
then it seems knew no drinker of sack who was a
Coward; at least the instance was not home and familiar
to him.—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They all</span></span>,”</span>
says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fall into a kind of Male
green sickness, and are generally fools and Cowards.</span></span>”</span> Anger
has a privilege, and I think <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> has a right to turn
the tables upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> if he can;
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span> was
certainly no fool, and I think upon the whole no Coward;
yet the Male green sickness which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> talks of seems
to have infected his manners and aspect, and taken from
him all external indication of gallantry and courage. He
behaves in the battle of Shrewsbury beyond the promise
of his complexion and deportment: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">By heaven thou hast
deceived me Lancaster</span></span>,”</span> says Harry, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I did not think thee
Lord of such a spirit!</span></span>”</span> Nor was his father less surprized
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">at his holding Lord Percy at the point with lustier maintenance
than he did look for from such an unripe warrior.</span></span>”</span>
But how well and unexpectedly soever he might have
behaved upon that occasion, he does not seem to have
been of a temper to trust fortune too much or too often
with his safety; therefore it is that, in order to keep the
event in his own hands, he loads the Die, in the present
case, with villainy and deceit: The event however he
piously ascribes, like a wise and prudent youth as he is,
without paying that worship to himself which he so justly
merits, to the special favour and interposition of Heaven.

But the profane <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, on the contrary, less informed
and less studious of supernatural things, imputes the whole
of this conduct to thin potations, and the not drinking
largely of good and excellent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sherris</span></span>; and so little doubt
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
does he seem to entertain of the Cowardice and ill disposition
of this youth, that he stands devising causes, and
casting about for an hypothesis on which the whole may be
physically explained and accounted for;—but I shall leave
him and Doctor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cadogan</span></span> to settle that point as they may.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only serious charge against <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Courage,
we have now at large examined; it came from great
authority, from the Commander in chief, and was meant
as chastisement and rebuke; but it appears to have been
founded in ill-will, in the particular character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>,
and in the wantonness and insolence of power; and the
author has placed near, and under our notice, full and
ample proofs of its injustice.—And thus the deeper we
look unto <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character, the stronger is our conviction
that he was not intended to be shewn as a
Constitutional coward: Censure cannot lay sufficient hold
on him,—and even malice turns away, and more than half
pronounces his acquittal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But as yet we have dealt principally in parole and
circumstantial evidence, and have referred to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fact</span></span> only
incidentally. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Facts</span></span> have a much more operative
influence: They may be produced, not as arguments
only, but Records; not to dispute alone, but to decide.—It
is time then to behold <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> in actual service as a
soldier, in danger, and in battle. We have already displayed
one fact in his defence against the censure of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>; a fact extremely unequivocal and decisive.
But the reader knows I have others, and doubtless goes
before me to the action at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shrewsbury</span></span>. In the midst and
in the heat of battle we see him come forwards;—what
are his words? <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I have led my Rag-o-muffians where they
are peppered; there's not three of my hundred and fifty
left alive.</span></span>”</span> But to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whom</span></em> does he say this? To himself
only; he speaks <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in soliloquy</span></em>. There is no questioning
the fact, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he had</span></em> led <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they were peppered</span></em>;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">there
were not </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">three</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> left alive.</span></span> He was in luck, being in bulk
equal to any two of them, to escape unhurt. Let the
author answer for that, I have nothing to do with it:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He was the Poetic maker of the whole <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Corps</span></span>, and he
might dispose of them as he pleased. Well might the
Chief justice, as we now find, acknowledge <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s
services in this day's battle; an acknowledgment which
amply confirms the fact. A Modern officer, who had
performed a feat of this kind, would expect, not only
the praise of having done his duty, but the appellation
of a hero. But poor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> has too much wit to thrive:
In spite of probability, in spite of inference, in spite of
fact, he must be a Coward still. He happens unfortunately
to have more Wit than Courage, and therefore
we are maliciously determined that he shall have
no Courage at all. But let us suppose that his modes
of expression, even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in soliloquy</span></em>, will admit of some abatement;—how
much shall we abate? Say that he brought
off <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fifty</span></em> instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em>; yet a Modern captain would be
apt to look big after an action with two thirds of his men,
as it were, in his belly. Surely <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> never meant
to exhibit this man as a Constitutional coward; if he did,
his means were sadly destructive of his end. We see him,
after he had expended his Rag-o-muffians, with sword
and target in the midst of battle, in perfect possession of
himself, and replete with humour and jocularity. He
was, I presume, in some immediate personal danger, in
danger also of a general defeat; too corpulent for flight;
and to be led a prisoner was probably to be led to
execution; yet we see him laughing and easy, offering a
bottle of sack to the Prince instead of a pistol, punning,
and telling him, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">there was that which
would </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">sack</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> a city.</span></span>”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What,
is it a time</span></span>,”</span> says the Prince <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to jest and dally
now?</span></span>”</span> No, a sober character would not jest on such
an occasion, but a Coward could not; he would neither
have the inclination, or the power. And what could
support <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> in such a situation? Not principle; he
is not suspected of the Point of honour; he seems indeed
fairly to renounce it. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Honour cannot set a leg or an arm;
it has no skill in surgery:—What is it? a word only; meer
air. It is insensible to the dead; and detraction will not let
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
it live with the living.</span></span>”</span> What then but a strong natural
constitutional Courage, which nothing could extinguish or
dismay?—In the following passages the true character of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> as to Courage and Principle is finely touched, and
the different colours at once nicely blended and distinguished.
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">If Percy be alive, I'll
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">pierce</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> him. If he
do come in my way, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">so</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">:—If
he do not, if I come in </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">his</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">
willingly, let him make a Carbonado of me. I like not such
grinning honour as Sir Walter hath; give me life; which
if I can save, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">so</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">; if not, honour comes unlook'd for, and
there's an end.</span></span>”</span> One cannot say which prevails most
here, profligacy or courage; they are both tinged alike by
the same humour, and mingled in one common mass;
yet when we consider the superior force of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Percy</span></span>, as we
must presently also that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Douglas</span></span>, we shall be apt, I
believe, in our secret heart, to forgive him. These
passages are spoken in soliloquy and in battle: If every
soliloquy made under similar circumstances were as
audible as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s, the imputation might perhaps be
found too general for censure. These are among the
passages that have impressed on the world an idea of
Cowardice in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>;—yet why? He is resolute to take
his fate: If <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Percy</span></span> do come in his way,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">so</span></span>;—if not, he will
not seek inevitable destruction; he is willing to save his
life, but if that cannot be, why,—<span class="tei tei-q">“honour comes unlook'd
for, and there's an end.”</span> This surely is not the language
of Cowardice: It contains neither the Bounce or Whine
of the character; he derides, it is true, and seems to
renounce that grinning idol of Military zealots, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Honour</span></span>.
But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> has a kind of Military free-thinker, and has
accordingly incurred the obloquy of his condition. He
stands upon the ground of natural Courage only and
common sense, and has, it seems, too much wit for a
hero.—But let me be well understood;—I do not justify
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> for renouncing the point of honour; it proceeded
doubtless from a general relaxation of mind, and profligacy
of temper. Honour is calculated to aid and
strengthen natural courage, and lift it up to heroism;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but natural courage, which can act as such without
honour, is natural courage still; the very quality I wish
to maintain to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>. And if, without the aid of
honour, he can act with firmness, his portion is only
the more eminent and distinguished. In such a character,
it is to his actions, not his sentiments, that we are to look
for conviction. But it may be still further urged in behalf
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, that there may be false honour as well as false
religion. It is true; yet even in that case candour
obliges me to confess that the best men are most disposed
to conform, and most likely to become the dupes of
their own virtue. But it may however be more reasonably
urged that there are particular tenets both in honour
and religion, which it is the grossness of folly not to
question. To seek out, to court assured destruction,
without leaving a single benefit behind, may be well
reckoned in the number: And this is precisely the very
folly which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> seems to abjure;—nor are we, perhaps,
intitled to say more, in the way of censure, than that he
had not virtue enough to become the dupe of honour, nor
prudence enough to hold his tongue. I am willing however,
if the reader pleases, to compound this matter, and
acknowledge, on my part, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was in all respects
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">old soldier</span></em>; that he had put himself under the sober
discipline of discretion, and renounced, in a great degree
at least, what he might call the Vanities and Superstitions
of honour; if the reader will, on his part, admit that this
might well be, without his renouncing, at the same time,
the natural firmness and resolution he was born to.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is a formidable objection behind. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
counterfeits basely on being attacked by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Douglas</span></span>; he
assumes, in a cowardly spirit, the appearance of death to
avoid the reality. But there was no equality of force;
not the least chance for victory, or life. And is it the
duty then, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">think we still</span></em>, of true Courage, to meet, without
benefit to society, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certain death</span></em>? Or is it only the
phantasy of honour?—But such a fiction is highly disgraceful;—true,
and a man of nice honour might perhaps
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grinned</span></em> for it. But we must
remember that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
had a double character; he was a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wit</span></em>
as well as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soldier</span></em>;
and his Courage, however eminent, was but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accessary</span></em>;
his wit was the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principal</span></em>; and the part, which, if they
should come in competition, he had the greatest interest
in maintaining. Vain indeed were the licentiousness of
his principles, if he should seek death like a bigot, yet
without the meed of honour; when he might live by wit,
and encrease the reputation of that wit by living. But
why do I labour this point? It has been already anticipated,
and our improved acquaintance with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> will
now require no more than a short narrative of the fact.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whilst in the battle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shrewsbury</span></span> he is exhorting and
encouraging the Prince who is engaged with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirit
Percy</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Well said Hal, to him Hal</span></span>,”</span>—he is
himself attacked by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fiend Douglas</span></span>. There was no match;
nothing remained but death or stratagem; grinning
honour, or laughing life. But an expedient offers, a
mirthful one,—Take your choice <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, a point of
honour, or a point of drollery.—It could not be a
question;—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
falls, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Douglas</span></span> is cheated, and the
world laughs. But does he fall like a Coward? No,
like a buffoon only; the superior principle prevails, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> lives by a stratagem growing out of his character,
to prove himself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no counterfeit</span></em>, to jest, to be employed,
and to fight again. That <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> valued himself, and
expected to be valued by others, upon this piece of saving
wit, is plain. It was a stratagem, it is true; it argued
presence of mind; but it was moreover, what he most
liked, a very laughable joke; and as such he considers it;
for he continues to counterfeit after the danger is over,
that he may also deceive the Prince, and improve the
event into more laughter. He might, for ought that
appears, have concealed the transaction; the Prince was
too earnestly engaged for observation; he might have
formed a thousand excuses for his fall; but he lies still and
listens to the pronouncing of his epitaph by the Prince
with all the waggish glee and levity of his character. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
circumstance of his wounding <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Percy</span></span> in the thigh, and
carrying the dead body on his back like luggage, is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indecent</span></em> but not cowardly. The declaring, though in jest,
that he killed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Percy</span></span>, seems
to me <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idle</span></em>, but it is not meant
or calculated for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imposition</span></em>; it is spoken to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Prince
himself</span></em>, the man in the world who could not be, or be
supposed to be, imposed on. But we must hear, whether
to the purpose or not, what it is that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Harry</span></em> has to say
over the remains of his old friend.

This is wonderfully proper for the occasion; it is
affectionate, it is pathetic, yet it remembers his vanities,
and, with a faint gleam of recollected mirth, even his
plumpness and corpulency; but it is a pleasantry softned

the sickly effort of a miserable pun.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>—But to our immediate

purpose,—why is not his Cowardice remembered
too? what, no surprize that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> should lye by the side
of the noble <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Percy</span></span> in the bed of honour! No reflection
that flight, though unfettered by disease, could not avail;
that fear could not find a subterfuge from death? Shall
his corpulency and his vanities be recorded, and his
more characteristic quality of Cowardice, even in the
moment that it particularly demanded notice and reflection,
be forgotten? If by sparing a better man be
here meant a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">better soldier</span></em>, there is no doubt but there
were better Soldiers in the army, more active, more
young, more principled, more knowing; but none, it
seems, taken for all in all, more acceptable. The comparative
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">better</span></em> used here leaves to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> the praise at
least of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>; and to be a good soldier, is to be a great
way from Coward. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s goodness, in this sort,
appears to have been not only enough to redeem him
from disgrace, but to mark him with reputation; if I was
to add with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eminence</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinction</span></em>, the funeral honours

Upon the whole of the passages yet before us, why may
I not reasonably hope that the good natured reader (and I

of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, as to valour, may be fairly and honestly
summed up in the very words which he himself uses to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harry</span></span>; and which seem, as to this point, to be intended
by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> as a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Compendium</span></span> of his character. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What</span></span>,”</span>

I know not what Impression has been made on the
reader; a good deal of evidence has been produced, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
much more remains to be offered. But how many sorts
of men are there whom no evidence can persuade! How
many, who, ignorant of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, or forgetful of the
text, may as well read heathen Greek, or the laws of the
land, as this unfortunate Commentary? How many,
who, proud and pedantic, hate all novelty, and damn it
without mercy under one compendious word, Paradox?
How many more, who, not deriving their opinions immediately
from the sovereignty of reason, hold at the will
of some superior lord, to whom accident or inclination
has attached them, and who, true to their vassalage, are
resolute not to surrender, without express permission,
their base and ill-gotten possessions. These, however
habited, are the mob of mankind, who hoot and holla,
hiss or huzza, just as their various leaders may direct.
I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">challenge</span></em> the whole Pannel as not holding by free tenure,
and therefore not competent to the purpose either of
condemnation or acquittal. But to the men of very nice
honour what shall be said? I speak not of your men of
good service, but such as Mr. —— <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Souls made of fire</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">children of the sun</span></span>.”</span> These gentlemen, I am sadly
afraid, cannot in honour or prudence admit of any composition
in the very nice article of Courage; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicion</span></em> is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disgrace</span></em>, and they cannot stay to parley with dishonour.
The misfortune in cases of this kind is that it is not easy
to obtain a fair and impartial Jury: When we censure
others with an eye to our own applause, we are as seldom
sparing of reproach, as inquisitive into circumstance; and
bold is the man who, tenacious of justice, shall venture to
weigh circumstances, or draw lines of distinction between
Cowardice and any apparently similar or neighbour quality:
As well may a lady, virgin or matron, of immaculate
honour, presume to pity or palliate the soft failing of some
unguarded friend, and thereby confess, as it were, those
sympathetic feelings which it behoves her to conceal under
the most contemptuous disdain; a disdain, always proportioned,
I believe, to a certain consciousness which we
must not explain. I am afraid that poor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suffered not a little, and may yet suffer by this fastidiousness
of temper. But though we may find these classes of
men rather unfavourable to our wishes, the Ladies, one
may hope, whose smiles are most worth our ambition,
may be found more propitious; yet they too, through a
generous conformity to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brave</span></em>, are apt to take up the
high tone of honour. Heroism is an idea perfectly conformable
to the natural delicacy and elevation of their
minds. Should we be fortunate enough therefore to
redeem <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> from the imputations of Cowardice, yet
plain Courage, I am afraid, will not serve the turn: Even
their heroes, I think, must be for the most part in the
bloom of youth, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">just where youth ends, in manhood's
freshest prime</span></span>; but to be <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old, cold, and of intolerable
entrails; to be fat and greasy; as poor as Job, and as
slanderous as Satan</span></span>”</span>;—Take him away, he merits not a
fair trial; he is too offensive to be turned, too odious to
be touched. I grant, indeed, that the subject of our
lecture is not without his infirmity; <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He cuts three inches
on the ribs, he was short-winded</span></span>,”</span> and his breath possibly
not of the sweetest. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He had the gout</span></span>,”</span> or something
worse, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">which played the rogue with his great toe.</span></span>”</span>—But
these considerations are not to the point; we shall conceal,
as much as may be, these offences; our business is
with his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heart</span></em> only, which, as we shall endeavour to
demonstrate, lies in the right place, and is firm and sound,
notwithstanding a few indications to the contrary.—As

elegant composition; and I am told your manners and
your mind are yet more pure, more elegant than your
book. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was too gross, too infirm, for your inspection;

would not have found Cowardice in the number of his
infirmities.—We will try if we cannot redeem him from
this universal censure.—Let the venal corporation of

authors duck <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the golden fool</span></em>, let them shape their sordid

though censured by an ungrateful world, and persecuted
from age to age by Critic and Commentator, and though
never rich enough to hire one literary prostitute, shall find
a Voluntary defender; and that too at a time when the
whole body of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nabobry</span></span> demands and requires defence;
whilst their ill-gotten and almost untold gold feels loose
in their unassured grasp, and whilst they are ready to
shake off portions of the enormous heap, that they may
the more securely clasp the remainder.—But not to
digress without end,—to the candid, to the chearful, to
the elegant reader we appeal; our exercise is much too
light for the sour eye of strict severity; it professes
amusement only, but we hope of a kind more rational
than the History of Miss <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Betsy</span></span>, eked out with the Story

to converse with this jovial, this fat, this roguish,
this frail, but, I think, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not cowardly</span></em> companion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though the robbery at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gads-Hill</span></span>, and the supposed
Cowardice of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> on that occasion, are next to be
considered, yet I must previously declare, that I think the
discussion of this matter to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em> unessential to the reestablishment
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s reputation as a man of Courage.
For suppose we should grant, in form, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> was
surprized with fear in this single instance, that he was off
his guard, and even acted like a Coward; what will follow,
but that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, like greater heroes, had his weak moment,
and was not exempted from panic and surprize? If a
single exception can destroy a general character, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hector</span></span>
was a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coward</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anthony</span></span> a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poltroon</span></span>. But for these
seeming contradictions of Character we shall seldom be at
a loss to account, if we carefully refer to circumstance and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
situation.—In the present instance, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> had done an
illegal act; the exertion was over; and he had unbent his
mind in security. The spirit of enterprize, and the
animating principle of hope, were withdrawn:—In this
situation, he is unexpectedly attacked; he has no time to
recall his thoughts, or bend his mind to action. He is
not now acting in the Profession and in the Habits of a
Soldier; he is associated with known Cowards; his
assailants are vigorous, sudden, and bold; he is conscious
of guilt; he has dangers to dread of every form, present
and future; prisons and gibbets, as well as sword and
fire; he is surrounded with darkness, and the Sheriff, the
Hangman, and the whole <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Posse Commitatus</span></span> may be at his
heels:—Without a moment for reflection, is it wonderful
that, under these circumstances, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he should run and roar,
and carry his guts away with as much dexterity as possible</span></span>”</span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But though I might well rest the question on this
ground, yet as there remains many good topics of vindication,
and as I think a more minute inquiry into this
matter will only bring out more evidence in support of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s constitutional Courage, I will not decline the
discussion. I beg permission therefore to state fully, as
well as fairly, the whole of this obnoxious transaction, this
unfortunate robbery at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gads-Hill</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the scene wherein we become first acquainted with
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, his character is opened in a manner worthy of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>: We see him in a green old age, mellow,
frank, gay, easy, corpulent, loose, unprincipled, and
luxurious; a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robber</span></span>,
as he says, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">by his vocation</span></span>; yet not
altogether so:—There was much, it seems, of mirth and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recreation</span></em> in the case:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The poor abuses of the times</span></span>,”</span> he
wantonly and humourously tells the Prince, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">want
countenance; and he hates to see resolution fobbed off, as
it is, by the rusty curb of old father antic, the law</span></span>.”</span>—When
he quits the scene, we are acquainted that he is only
passing to the Tavern: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Farewell,</span></span>”</span> says he, with an air
of careless jollity and gay content, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You will find me in
East-Cheap.</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Farewell,</span></span>”</span>
says the Prince, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thou latter
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
spring; farewell, all-hallown summer.</span></span>”</span> But though all this
is excellent for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s purposes, we find, as yet at
least, no hint of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Cowardice, no appearance of
Braggadocio, or any preparation whatever for laughter
under this head.—The instant <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
is withdrawn, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>
opens to the Prince his meditated scheme of a double
robbery; and here then we may reasonably expect to be
let into these parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character.—We shall see.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poins. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Now my good sweet lord, ride with us tomorrow;
I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage
alone. </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Falstaff</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Bardolph</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Peto</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">,
and </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Gadshill</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> shall rob
those men that we have already waylaid; yourself and I
will not be there; and when they have the booty, if you and
I do not rob them, cut this head from off my shoulders.</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is giving strong surety for his words; perhaps he
thought the case required it: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">But how</span></span>,”</span> says the Prince,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shall we part with
them in setting forth?</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> is ready
with his answer; he had matured the thought, and could
solve every difficulty:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They could set out before, or after;
their horses might be tied in the wood; they could change
their visors; and he had already procured cases of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">buckram</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">
to inmask their outward garments.</span></span>”</span> This was going far;
it was doing business in good earnest. But if we look
into the Play we shall be better able to account for this
activity; we shall find that there was at least as much
malice as jest in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>'s intention. The rival situations of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> had produced on both sides much
jealousy and ill will, which occasionally appears, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s
manner, by side lights, without confounding the
main action; and by the little we see of this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>, he
appears to be an unamiable, if not a very brutish and bad,
character.—But to pass this;—the Prince next says, with
a deliberate and wholesome caution, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I doubt they will
be too hard for us.</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>'s
reply is remarkable; <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Well,
for </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">two</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> of them, I know them to be as true bred Cowards as
ever turned back; and for the </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">third</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, if he fights longer than
he sees cause, I will forswear arms.</span></span>”</span> There is in this
reply a great deal of management: There were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
persons in all, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> well knew, and he had himself, but
a little before, named them,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bardolph</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peto</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gadshill</span></span>; but now he omits one of the number, which
must be either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, as not subject to any imputation
in point of Courage; and in that case <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peto</span></span> will be the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>;—or, as I rather think, in order to diminish the
force of the Prince's objection, he artfully drops <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gadshill</span></span>,
who was then out of town, and might therefore be supposed
to be less in the Prince's notice; and upon this supposition
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> will be the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">third, who will not fight longer than he sees
reason</span></span>. But on either supposition, what evidence is there
of a pre-supposed Cowardice in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>? On the contrary,
what stronger evidence can we require that the Courage of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> had to this hour, through various trials, stood
wholly unimpeached, than that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>,
the ill-disposed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>,
who ventures, for his own purposes, to steal, as it were,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em> from the notice and memory of the Prince,
and who shews himself, from worse motives, as skilfull in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diminishing</span></em> as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
appears afterwards to be in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">increasing</span></em>
of numbers, than that this very <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> should not venture
to put down <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> in the list of Cowards; though the
occasion so strongly required that he should be degraded.
What <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> dares do
however in this sort, he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As to
the third</span></span>,”</span> for so he describes
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> (as if the name of
this Veteran would have excited too strongly the ideas
of Courage and resistance), <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">if he fights longer than he sees
reason, I will forswear arms.</span></span>”</span> This is the old trick of
cautious and artful malice: The turn of expression, or the
tone of voice does all; for as to the words themselves,
simply considered, they might be now truly spoken of
almost any man who ever lived, except the iron-headed
hero of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sweden</span></span>.—But
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> however adds something,
which may appear more decisive; <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The virtue of this jest
will be the incomprehensible lyes which this fat rogue will
tell when we meet at supper; how thirty at least he fought
with; and what wards, what blows, what extremities, he
endured: And in the reproof of this lies the jest</span></span>”</span>:—Yes,
and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">malice</span></em> too.—This prediction was unfortunately
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fulfilled, even beyond the letter of it; a completion more
incident, perhaps, to the predictions of malice than of
affection. But we shall presently see how far either the
prediction, or the event, will go to the impeachment of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Courage.—The Prince, who is never duped,
comprehends the whole of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>'s views. But let that
pass.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the next scene we behold all the parties at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gads-Hill</span></span>
in preparation for the robbery. Let us carefully examine
if it contains any intimation of Cowardice in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>. He
is shewn under a very ridiculous vexation about his horse,
which is hid from him; but this is nothing to the purpose,
or only proves that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> knew no terror equal to that
of walking <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eight yards of uneven ground</span></span>. But on occasion
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gadshill</span></span>'s being asked concerning the number of the
travellers, and having reported that they were eight or ten,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> exclaims,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zounds! will they not rob us!</span></span>”</span> If he
had said more seriously, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I doubt
they will be too hard for us</span></span>,”</span>—he
would then have only used the Prince's own words
upon a less alarming occasion. This cannot need defence.
But the Prince, in his usual stile of mirth, replies, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What a
Coward, Sir John Paunch!</span></span>”</span> To this one would naturally
expect from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> some light answer; but we are surprized
with a very serious one;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I
am not indeed </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">John of
Gaunt</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> your grandfather, but yet no
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Coward</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Hal</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">.</span></span>”</span> This
is singular: It contains, I think, the true character of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>; and it seems to
be thrown out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">here</span></em>, at a very
critical conjuncture, as a caution to the audience not to
take too sadly what was intended only (to use the Prince's
words) <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as argument for a week, laughter for a month, and
a good jest for ever after</span></span>.”</span> The whole of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s past
life could not, it should seem, furnish the Prince with
a reply, and he is, therefore, obliged to draw upon the
coming hope. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Well</span></span>,”</span>
says he, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mysteriously</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">let the event
try</span></span>”</span>; meaning the event of the concerted attack on
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>; an event so probable, that he might indeed
venture to rely on it.—But the travellers approach: The
Prince hastily proposes a division of strength; that he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> should take a station separate from the rest, so
that if the travellers should escape one party, they might
light on the other: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> does not object, though he
supposes the travellers to be eight or ten in number. We
next see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> attack these travellers with alacrity, using
the accustomed words of threat and terror;—they make
no resistance, and he binds and robs them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hitherto I think there has not appeared the least <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trait</span></em>
either of boast or fear in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>. But now comes on the
concerted transaction, which has been the source of so
much dishonour. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As they are sharing the booty</span></span> (says the
stage direction) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Prince and
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Poins</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> set upon them, they all
run away; and </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Falstaff</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> after a blow or two runs away too,
leaving the booty behind them.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Got
with much ease,</span></span>”</span> says
the Prince, as an event beyond expectation, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Now merrily
to horse.</span></span>”</span>—Poins adds, as they are going off, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">How the
rogue roared!</span></span>”</span> This observation is afterwards remembered
by the Prince, who, urging the jest to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
says, doubtless with all the licence of exaggeration,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">And
you, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Falstaff</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, carried your guts away as nimbly, with as
quick dexterity, and roared for mercy, and still ran and
roared, as I ever heard bull-calf.</span></span>”</span> If he did roar for
mercy, it must have been a very inarticulate sort of roaring;
for there is not a single word set down for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
from which this roaring may be inferred, or any stage
direction to the actor for that purpose: But, in the spirit
of mirth and derision, the lightest exclamation might be
easily converted into the roar of a bull-calf.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have now gone through this transaction considered
simply on its own circumstances, and without reference to
any future boast or imputation. It is upon these circumstances
the case must be tried, and every colour subsequently
thrown upon it, either by wit or folly, ought to
be discharged. Take it, then, as it stands hitherto, with
reference only to its own preceding and concomitant
circumstances, and to the unbounded ability of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>
to obtain his own ends, and we must, I think, be compelled
to confess that this transaction was never intended by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> to detect and expose the false pretences of
a real Coward; but, on the contrary, to involve a man of
allowed Courage, though in other respects of a very
peculiar character, in such circumstances and suspicions
of Cowardice as might, by the operation of those peculiarities,
produce afterwards much temporary mirth among
his familiar and intimate companions: Of this we cannot
require a stronger proof than the great attention which is
paid to the decorum and truth of character in the stage
direction already quoted: It appears, from thence, that it
was not thought <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">decent</span></em> that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> should run at all, until
he had been deserted by his companions, and had even
afterwards exchanged blows with his assailants;—and thus,
a just distinction is kept up between the natural Cowardice
of the three associates and the accidental Terror of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hitherto, then, I think it is very clear that no laughter
either is, or is intended to be, raised upon the score of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Cowardice. For after all, it is not singularly
ridiculous that an old inactive man of no boast, as far as
appears, or extraordinary pretensions to valour, should
endeavour to save himself by flight from the assault of
two bold and vigorous assailants. The very Players, who
are, I think, the very worst judges of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, have
been made sensible, I suppose from long experience, that
there is nothing in this transaction to excite any extraordinary
laughter; but this they take to be a defect in the
management of their author, and therefore I imagine it is,
that they hold themselves obliged to supply the vacancy,
and fill it up with some low buffoonery of their own.
Instead of the dispatch necessary on this occasion, they
bring <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stuffing and
all</span></em>, to the very front of the
stage; where, with much mummery and grimace, he seats
himself down, with a canvas money-bag in his hand, to
divide the spoil. In this situation he is attacked by the
Prince and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>, whose tin swords hang idly in the air and
delay to strike till the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Player Falstaff</span></span>, who seems more
troubled with flatulence than fear, is able to rise: which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is not till after some ineffectual efforts, and with the
assistance (to the best of my memory) of one of the
thieves, who lingers behind, in spite of terror, for this
friendly purpose; after which, without any resistance on
his part, he is goaded off the stage like a fat ox for
slaughter by these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stony-hearted</span></em> drivers in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">buckram</span></em>. I
think he does not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">roar</span></em>;—perhaps the player had never
perfected himself in the tones of a bull-calf. This whole
transaction should be shewn between the interstices of a
back scene: The less we see in such cases, the better we
conceive. Something of resistance and afterwards of
celerity in flight we should be made witnesses of; the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">roar</span></em> we should take on the credit of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>. Nor is
there any occasion for all that bolstering with which they fill up
the figure of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>; they do not distinguish betwixt
humourous exaggeration and necessary truth. The Prince
is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">starveling</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dried neat's
tongue</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stock-fish</span></em>, and other
names of the same nature. They might with almost as
good reason search the glass-houses for some exhausted
stoker to furnish out a Prince of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wales</span></span> of sufficient
correspondence to this picture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We next come to the scene of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s braggadocioes.
I have already wandered too much into details; yet I
must, however, bring <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> forward to this last scene of
trial in all his proper colouring and proportions. The
progressive discovery of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character is excellently
managed.—In the first scene we become acquainted with
his figure, which we must in some degree consider as
a part of his character; we hear of his gluttony and his
debaucheries, and become witnesses of that indistinguishable
mixture of humour and licentiousness which runs
through his whole character; but what we are principally
struck with, is the ease of his manners and deportment, and
the unaffected freedom and wonderful pregnancy of his
wit and humour. We see him, in the next scene, agitated
with vexation: His horse is concealed from him, and he
gives on this occasion so striking a description of his
distress, and his words so labour and are so loaded with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heat and vapour, that, but for laughing, we should pity
him; laugh, however, we must at the extreme incongruity
of a man, at once corpulent and old, associating with youth
in an enterprize demanding the utmost extravagance of
spirit, and all the wildness of activity: And this it is
which make his complaints so truly ridiculous. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Give me
my horse!</span></span>”</span> says he, in another spirit than that of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richard</span></span>;
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eight yards of uneven ground</span></span>,”</span> adds this
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Forrester of Diana</span></span>, this
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">enterprising gentleman of the shade</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is threescore and ten miles
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">a-foot</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> with me.</span></span>”</span>—In the heat
and agitation of the robbery, out comes more and more
extravagant instances of incongruity. Though he is most
probably older and much fatter than either of the
travellers, yet he calls them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bacons, Bacon-fed, and
gorbellied knaves</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hang them</span></span>,”</span>
says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fat chuffs, they
hate us youth: What! young men, must live:—You are
grand Jurors, are ye? We'll jure ye, i' faith.</span></span>”</span> But, as
yet, we do not see the whole length and breadth of him:
This is reserved for the braggadocio scene. We expect
entertainment, but we don't well know of what kind.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>, by his prediction, has given us a hint: But we do
not see or feel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> to be a Coward, much less a
boaster; without which even Cowardice is not sufficiently
ridiculous; and therefore it is, that on the stage we find
them always connected. In this uncertainty on our part,
he is, with much artful preparation, produced.—His
entrance is delayed to stimulate our expectation; and, at
last, to take off the dullness of anticipation, and to add
surprize to pleasure, he is called in, as if for another
purpose of mirth than what we are furnished with: We
now behold him, fluctuating with fiction, and labouring
with dissembled passion and chagrin: Too full for
utterance, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> provokes him by a few simple words,
containing a fine contrast of affected ease,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Welcome,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Jack</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, where hast thou been?</span></span>”</span> But when we hear him
burst forth, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A plague on all Cowards! Give me a cup
of sack. Is there no virtue extant!</span></span>”</span>—We are at once in
possession of the whole man, and are ready to hug him,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
guts, lyes and all, as an inexhaustible fund of pleasantry
and humour. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cowardice</span></em>, I apprehend, is out of our
thought; it does not, I think, mingle in our mirth. As
to this point, I have presumed to say already, and I repeat
it, that we are, in my opinion, the dupes of our own
wisdom, of systematic reasoning, of second thought, and
after reflection. The first spectators, I believe, thought of
nothing but the laughable scrape which so singular a
character was falling into, and were delighted to see a
humourous and unprincipled wit so happily taken in his
own inventions, precluded from all rational defence, and
driven to the necessity of crying out, after a few ludicrous
evasions, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">No more of that,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Hal</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, if thou lov'st me.</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not conceive myself obliged to enter into a
consideration of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s lyes concerning the transaction
at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gad's-Hill</span></span>. I have considered his conduct as independent
of those lyes; I have examined the whole
of it apart, and found it free of Cowardice or fear, except
in one instance, which I have endeavoured to account for
and excuse. I have therefore a right to infer that those
lyes are to be derived, not from Cowardice, but from
some other part of his character, which it does not concern
me to examine: But I have not contented myself hitherto
with this sort of negative defence; and the reader I
believe is aware that I am resolute (though I confess not
untired) to carry this fat rogue out of the reach of every
imputation which affects, or may seem to affect, his natural
Courage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first observation then which strikes us, as to his
braggadocioes, is, that they are braggadocioes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after the fact</span></em>.
In other cases we see the Coward of the Play bluster and
boast for a time, talk of distant wars, and private duels,
out of the reach of knowledge and of evidence; of storms
and stratagems, and of falling in upon the enemy pell-mell
and putting thousands to the sword; till, at length, on
the proof of some present and apparent fact, he is brought
to open and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lasting</span></em> shame; to shame I mean as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Coward</span></em>;
for as to what there is of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lyar</span></em> in the case, it is considered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only as accessory, and scarcely reckoned into the account
of dishonour.—But in the instance before us, every thing
is reversed: The Play opens with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fact</span></em>; a Fact, from
its circumstances as well as from the age and inactivity of
the man, very excusable and capable of much apology,
if not of defence. This Fact is preceded by no bluster or
pretence whatever;—the lyes and braggadocioes follow;
but they are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em>; they are confined and have
reference to this one Fact only; the detection is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate</span></em>;
and after some accompanying mirth and laughter, the
shame of that detection ends; it has no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duration</span></em>, as in
other cases; and, for the rest of the Play, the character
stands just where it did before, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without any punishment
or degradation whatever</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To account for all this, let us only suppose that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
was a man of natural Courage, though in all respects
unprincipled; but that he was surprized in one single
instance into an act of real terror; which, instead of
excusing upon circumstances, he endeavours to cover by
lyes and braggadocio; and that these lyes become thereupon
the subject, in this place, of detection. Upon these
suppositions the whole difficulty will vanish at once, and
every thing be natural, common, and plain. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fact</span></span>
itself will be of course <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">excusable</span></em>; that is, it will arise out
of a combination of such circumstances as, being applicable
to one case only, will not destroy the general character:
It will not be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">preceded</span></em> by any braggadocio, containing any
fair indication of Cowardice; as real Cowardice is not
supposed to exist in the character. But the first act
of real or apparent Cowardice would naturally throw a
vain unprincipled man into the use of lyes and braggadocio;
but these would have reference only to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fact in
question</span></em>, and not apply to other cases or infect his general
character, which is not supposed to stand in need of
imposition. Again,—the detection of Cowardice, as such,
is more diverting after a long and various course of
Pretence, where the lye of character is preserved, as it
were, whole, and brought into sufficient magnitude for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a burst of discovery; yet, mere occasional lyes, such as
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is hereby supposed to utter, are, for the purpose
of sport, best detected in the telling; because, indeed,
they cannot be preserved for a future time; the exigence
and the humour will be past: But the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shame</span></em> arising to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> from the detection of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mere lyes</span></em> would be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporary
only</span></em>; his character as to this point, being already known,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tolerated for the humour</span></em>. Nothing, therefore, could
follow but mirth and laughter, and the temporary triumph
of baffling a wit at his own weapons, and reducing him
to an absolute surrender: After which, we ought not
to be surprized if we see him rise again, like a boy from
play, and run another race with as little dishonour as
before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What then can we say, but that it is clearly the lyes
only, not the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cowardice</span></em>, of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> which are here detected:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lyes</span></em>, to which what there may be of Cowardice is incidental
only, improving indeed the Jest, but by no means
the real Business of the scene.—And now also we may
more clearly discern the true force and meaning of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poin</span></span>'s
prediction. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Jest will
be</span></span>,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the incomprehensible
Lyes that this fat rogue will tell us: How thirty at least he
fought with:—and in the reproof of this lyes the jest</span></span>”</span>;
That is, in the detection of these lyes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simply</span></em>; for as to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Courage</span></em>, he had never ventured to insinuate more than
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> would not fight longer than he saw cause:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span> was in expectation
indeed that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> would fall
into some dishonour on this occasion; an event highly
probable: But this was not, it seems, to be the principal
ground of their mirth, but the detection of those <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">incomprehensible
lyes</span></span>, which he boldly predicts, upon his knowledge
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character,
this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fat rogue</span></span>, not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coward</span></span>, would
tell them. This prediction therefore, and the completion
of it, go only to the impeachment of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff's veracity</span></span>, and
not of his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Courage</span></em>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">These lyes</span></span>,”</span> says the Prince, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">are like
the father of them, gross as a mountain, open, palpable.—Why,
thou clay-brained gutts, thou knotty-pated fool; how
couldst thou know these men in Kendal Green, when it was so

dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your
reason.</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Poins. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Come, your reason,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Jack</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, your reason.</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, says the Prince, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hear how a plain Tale shall
put you down—What trick, what device, what starting hole
canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
apparent shame?</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Poins. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Come, let's hear,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Jack</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, what trick hast thou
now?</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this clearly refers to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s
lyes only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as such</span></em>;
and the objection seems to be, that he had not told them
well, and with sufficient skill and probability. Indeed
nothing seems to have been required of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> at any
period of time but a good evasion. The truth is, that
there is so much mirth, and so little of malice or imposition
in his fictions, that they may for the most part be
considered as mere strains of humour and exercises of
wit, impeachable only for defect, when that happens, of the
quality from which they are principally derived. Upon
this occasion <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s evasions fail him; he is at the end
of his invention; and it seems fair that, in defect of wit,
the law should pass upon him, and that he should undergo
the temporary censure of that Cowardice which he could
not pass off by any evasion whatever. The best he
could think of, was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instinct</span></em>: He was indeed a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Coward
upon instinct</span></em>; in that respect <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">like a valiant lion, who would
not touch the true Prince</span></span>. It would have been a vain
attempt, the reader will easily perceive, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, to have
gone upon other ground, and to have aimed at justifying
his Courage by a serious vindication: This would have been
to have mistaken the true point of argument: It was his
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lyes</span></em>, not his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Courage</span></em>, which was really in question. There
was besides no getting out of the toils in which he had
entangled himself: If he was not, he ought at least, by
his own shewing, to have <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">been at half-sword with a dozen of
them two hours together</span></span>; whereas, it unfortunately appears,
and that too evidently to be evaded, that he had run with
singular celerity from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em>, after the exchange of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a few
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
blows</span></em> only. This precluded <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> from all rational
defence in his own person;—but it has not precluded me,
who am not the advocate of his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lyes</span></em>, but of his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Courage</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there are other singularities in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s lyes, which
go more directly to his vindication.—That they are
confined to one scene and one occasion only, we are not
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em> at a loss to account for;—but what shall we say
to their extravagance? The lyes of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parolles</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bobadill</span></span>
are brought into some shape; but the fictions of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
are so preposterous and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomprehensible</span></em>, that one may
fairly doubt if they ever were intended for credit; and
therefore, if they ought to be called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lyes</span></em>, and not rather
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">humour</span></em>; or, to compound the matter,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">humourous rhodomontades</span></span>.
Certain it is, that they destroy their own
purpose, and are clearly not the effect, in this respect, of a
regulated practice, and a habit of imposition. The real
truth seems to be, that had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, loose and unprincipled
as he is, been born a Coward and bred a Soldier, he must,
naturally, have been a great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Braggadocio</span></span>,
a true <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">miles
gloriosus</span></span>. But in such case he should have been
exhibited active and young; for it is plain that age and
corpulency are an excuse for Cowardice, which ought not
to be afforded him. In the present case, wherein he was
not only involved in suspicious circumstances, but wherein
he seems to have felt some conscious touch of infirmity,
and having no candid construction to expect from his
laughing companions, he bursts at once, and with all
his might, into the most unweighed and preposterous
fictions, determined to put to proof on this occasion his
boasted talent of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">swearing truth out of England</span></span>. He tried
it here, to its utmost extent, and was unfortunately routed
on his own ground; which indeed, with such a mine
beneath his feet, could not be otherwise. But without
this, he had mingled in his deceits so much whimsical
humour and fantastic exaggeration that he must have been
detected; and herein appears the admirable address of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, who can
shew us <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> in the various light,
not only of what he is, but what he would have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under one single variation of character,—the want of
natural Courage; whilst with an art not enough understood,
he most effectually preserves the real character of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> even in the moment he seems to depart from it,
by making his lyes too extravagant for practised imposition;
by grounding them more upon humour than
deceit; and turning them, as we shall next see, into a fair
and honest proof of general Courage, by appropriating
them to the concealment only of a single exception. And
hence it is, that we see him draw so deeply and so confidently
upon his former credit for Courage and atchievment:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I never dealt better in my life,—thou know'st my old
ward, Hal</span></span>,”</span> are expressions which clearly refer to some
known feats and defences of his former life. His exclamations
against Cowardice, his reference to his own
manhood, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die when thou
wilt, old </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Jack</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, if manhood,
good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then
am I a shotten herring</span></span>”</span>: These, and various expressions
such as these, would be absurdities not impositions,
Farce not Comedy, if not calculated to conceal some
defect supposed unknown to the hearers; and these
hearers were, in the present case, his constant companions,
and the daily witnesses of his conduct. If before this
period he had been a known and detected Coward, and
was conscious that he had no credit to lose, I see no
reason why he should fly so violently from a familiar
ignominy which had often before attacked him; or why
falshoods, seemingly in such a case neither calculated for
or expecting credit, should be censured, or detected, as
lyes or imposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the whole transaction was considered as a mere
jest, and as carrying with it no serious imputation on the
Courage of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, is manifest, not only from his being
allowed, when the laugh was past, to call himself, without
contradiction in the personated character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hal</span></span> himself,
<span class="tei tei-q">“valiant <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jack Falstaff, and

and, above all, from the declaration, which the Prince

makes on that very night, of his intention of procuring
this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fat rogue a Charge of foot</span></span>;—a circumstance, doubtless,
contrived by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> to wipe off the seeming dishonour
of the day: And from this time forward we hear
of no imputation arising from this transaction; it is born
and dies in a convivial hour; it leaves no trace behind, nor
do we see any longer in the character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> the boasting
or braggadocio of a Coward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tho' I have considered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character as relative
only to one single quality, yet so much has been said, that
it cannot escape the reader's notice that he is a character
made up by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> wholly of incongruities;—a man
at once young and old, enterprizing and fat, a dupe and a
wit, harmless and wicked, weak in principle and resolute
by constitution, cowardly in appearance and brave in
reality; a knave without malice, a lyar without deceit;
and a knight, a gentleman, and a soldier, without either
dignity, decency, or honour: This is a character, which,
though it may be de-compounded, could not, I believe,
have been formed, nor the ingredients of it duly mingled,
upon any receipt whatever: It required the hand of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> himself to give to every particular part a relish
of the whole, and of the whole to every particular part;—alike
the same incongruous, identical <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, whether to
the grave Chief Justice he vainly talks of his youth,
and offers to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">caper for a
thousand</span></span>; or cries to Mrs. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Doll</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I am old, I am old</span></span>,”</span> though she is seated on his lap, and
he is courting her for busses. How <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> could
furnish out sentiment of so extraordinary a composition,
and supply it with such appropriated and characteristic
language, humour and wit, I cannot tell; but I may, however,
venture to infer, and that confidently, that he who
so well understood the uses of incongruity, and that
laughter was to be raised by the opposition of qualities in
the same man, and not by their agreement or conformity,
would never have attempted to raise mirth by shewing
us Cowardice in a Coward unattended by Pretence, and
softened by every excuse of age, corpulence, and infirmity:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And of this we cannot have a more striking proof than his
furnishing this very character, on one instance of real
terror, however excusable, with boast, braggadocio, and
pretence, exceeding that of all other stage Cowards the
whole length of his superior wit, humour, and invention.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What then upon the whole shall be said but that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>
has made certain Impressions, or produced certain
effects, of which he has thought fit to conceal or obscure
the cause? How he has done this, and for what special
ends, we shall now presume to guess.—Before the period
in which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> wrote, the fools and Zanys of the
stage were drawn out of the coarsest and cheapest
materials: Some essential folly, with a dash of knave and
coxcomb, did the feat. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, who delighted in
difficulties, was resolved to furnish a richer repast, and to
give to one eminent buffoon the high relish of wit,
humour, birth, dignity, and Courage. But this was a
process which required the nicest hand, and the utmost
management and address: These enumerated qualities are,
in their own nature, productive of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respect</span></em>; an Impression
the most opposite to laughter that can be. This Impression
then, it was, at all adventures, necessary to
with-hold; which could not perhaps well be without
dressing up these qualities in fantastic forms, and colours
not their own; and thereby cheating the eye with shews of
baseness and of folly, whilst he stole as it were upon the
palate a richer and a fuller <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">goût</span></span>. To this end, what arts,
what contrivances, has he not practised! How has he
steeped this singular character in bad habits for fifty years
together, and brought him forth saturated with every
folly and with every vice not destructive of his essential
character, or incompatible with his own primary design!
For this end, he has deprived <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> of every good
principle; and for another, which will be presently
mentioned, he has concealed every bad one. He has
given him also every infirmity of body that is not likely
to awaken our compassion, and which is most proper to
render both his better qualities and his vices ridiculous: he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has associated levity and debauch with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">age</span></em>, corpulence and
inactivity with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">courage</span></em>, and has roguishly coupled the gout
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Military honours</span></em>, and a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pension</span></em>
with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pox</span></em>. He has
likewise involved this character in situations, out of which
neither wit nor Courage can extricate him with honour.
The surprize at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gads-Hill</span></span> might have betrayed a hero into
flight, and the encounter with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Douglas</span></span> left him no choice
but death or stratagem. If he plays an after-game, and
endeavours to redeem his ill fortune by lies and braggadocio,
his ground fails him; no wit, no evasion will avail:
Or is he likely to appear respectable in his person, rank,
and demeanor, how is that respect abated or discharged!
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has given him a kind of state indeed; but of
what is it composed? Of that fustian cowardly rascal
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pistol</span></span>, and his yoke-fellow of few words, the equally deed-less
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nym</span></span>; of his cup-bearer
the fiery <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trigon</span></span>, whose zeal
burns in his nose, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bardolph</span></span>; and of the boy, who bears
the purse with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seven groats and two-pence</span></span>;—a boy who was
given him on purpose to set him off, and whom he walks
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em>, according to his own
description, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">like a sow that
had overwhelmed all her litter but one</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it was not enough to render <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> ridiculous in
his figure, situations, and equipage; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still</span></em> his respectable
qualities would have come forth, at least occasionally, to
spoil our mirth; or they might have burst the intervention
of such slight impediments, and have every where
shone through: It was necessary then to go farther, and
throw on him that substantial ridicule, which only the incongruities
of real vice can furnish; of vice, which was to
be so mixed and blended with his frame as to give a
durable character and colour to the whole.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it may here be necessary to detain the reader a
moment in order to apprize him of my further intention;
without which, I might hazard that good understanding,
which I hope has hitherto been preserved between us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have 'till now looked only to the Courage of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
a quality which, having been denied, in terms, to belong to
his constitution, I have endeavoured to vindicate to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Understandings of my readers; the Impression on their
Feelings (in which all Dramatic truth consists) being
already, as I have supposed, in favour of the character.
In the pursuit of this subject I have taken the general
Impression of the whole character pretty much, I suppose,
like other men; and, when occasion has required, have so
transmitted it to the reader; joining in the common
Feeling of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s pleasantry, his apparent freedom
from ill principle, and his companionable wit and good
humour: With a stage character, in the article of
exhibition, we have nothing more to do; for in fact
what is it but an Impression; an appearance, which we
are to consider as a reality, and which we may venture to
applaud or condemn as such, without further inquiry or
investigation? But if we would account for our Impressions,
or for certain sentiments or actions in a
character, not derived from its apparent principles, yet
appearing, we know not why, natural, we are then compelled
to look farther, and examine if there be not
something more in the character than is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shewn</span></em>; something
inferred, which is not brought under our special notice:
In short, we must look to the art of the writer, and to the
principles of human nature, to discover the hidden causes
of such effects.—Now this is a very different matter.—The
former considerations respected the Impression only, without
regard to the Understanding; but this question
relates to the Understanding alone. It is true that there
are but few Dramatic characters which will bear this
kind of investigation, as not being drawn in exact conformity
to those principles of general nature to which we
must refer. But this is not the case with regard to the
characters of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>;
they are struck out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em>, by
some happy art which I cannot clearly comprehend, out
of the general mass of things, from the block as it were of
nature: And it is, I think, an easier thing to give a just
draught of man from these Theatric forms, which I cannot
help considering as originals, than by drawing from real
life, amidst so much intricacy, obliquity, and disguise. If
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
therefore, for further proofs of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s Courage, or for
the sake of curious speculation, or for both, I change my
position, and look to causes instead of effects, the reader
must not be surprized if he finds the former <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
vanish like a dream, and another, of more disgustful form,
presented to his view; one whose final punishment we
shall be so far from regretting, that we ourselves shall be
ready to consign him to a severer doom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reader will very easily apprehend that a character,
which we might wholly disapprove of, considered as
existing in human life, may yet be thrown on the stage
into certain peculiar situations, and be compressed by
external influences into such temporary appearances, as
may render such character for a time highly acceptable and
entertaining, and even more distinguished for qualities,
which on this supposition would be accidents only, than
another character really possessing those qualities, but
which, under the pressure of the same situation and
influences, would be distorted into a different form, or
totally left in timidity and weakness. If therefore the
character before us will admit of this kind of investigation,
our Inquiry will not be without some dignity, considered
as extending to the principles of human nature, and to the
genius and arts of Him, who has best caught every
various form of the human mind, and transmitted them
with the greatest happiness and fidelity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To return then to the vices of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>.—We have
frequently referred to them under the name of ill habits;—but
perhaps the reader is not fully aware how very
vicious he indeed is;—he is a robber, a glutton, a cheat, a
drunkard, and a lyar; lascivious, vain, insolent, profligate,
and profane:—A fine infusion this, and such as without
very excellent cookery must have thrown into the dish a
great deal too much of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fumet</span></span>.
It was a nice operation;—these
vices were not only to be of a particular sort,
but it was also necessary to guard them at both ends; on
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, from all appearance of malicious motive, and indeed
from the manifestation of any ill principle whatever, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must have produced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disgust</span></em>,—a sensation no less opposite
to laughter than is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respect</span></em>;—and, on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em>, from the
notice, or even apprehension, in the spectators, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pernicious
effect</span></em>; which produces <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grief</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">terror</span></em>, and is the
proper province of Tragedy alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Actions</span></em> cannot with strict propriety be said to be either
virtuous or vicious. These qualities, or attributes, belong
to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agents</span></em> only; and are derived, even in respect to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>,
from intention alone. The abstracting of qualities, and
considering them as independent of any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject</span></em>, and the
applying of them afterwards to actions independent of the
agent, is a double operation which I do not pretend, thro'
any part of it, to understand. All actions may most
properly, in their own nature, I think, be called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">neutral</span></em>;
tho' in common discourse, and in writing where perfection
is not requisite, we often term them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vicious</span></em>, transferring on
these occasions the attributive from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agent</span></em>
to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em>;
and sometimes we call them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evil</span></em>, or of pernicious effect,
by transferring, in like manner, the injuries incidentally
arising from certain actions to the life, happiness, or
interest of human beings, to the natural operation,
whether moral or physical, of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actions</span></em>
themselves: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One</span></em>
is a colour thrown on them by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intention</span></em>, in which I
think consists all moral turpitude, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em> by effect:
If therefore a Dramatic writer will use certain managements
to keep vicious intention as much as possible from
our notice, and make us sensible that no evil effect
follows, he may pass off actions of very vicious motive,
without much ill impression, as mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incongruities</span></em>, and the
effect of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">humour</span></em> only;—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">words these</span></em>, which, as applied to
human conduct, are employed, I believe, to cover a great
deal of what may deserve much harder appellation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">difference</span></em> between suffering an evil effect to take
place, and of preventing such effect, from actions precisely
of the same nature, is so great, that it is often <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the
difference</span></em> between Tragedy and Comedy. The Fine gentleman
of the Comic scene, who so promptly draws his
sword, and wounds, without killing, some other gentleman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the same sort; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></em> of Tragedy, whose stabs are
mortal, differ very frequently in no other point whatever.
If our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> had really
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peppered</span></em> (as he calls it) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">two rogues
in buckram suits</span></span>, we must have looked for a very different
conclusion, and have expected to have found <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s
Essential prose converted into blank verse, and to have
seen him move off, in slow and measured paces, like the
City Prentice to the tolling of a Passing bell;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he would
have become a cart as well as another, or a plague on
his bringing up.</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every incongruity in a rational being is a source of
laughter, whether it respects manners, sentiments, conduct,
or even dress, or situation;—but the greatest of all possible
incongruity is vice, whether in the intention itself, or as
transferred to, and becoming more manifest in action;—it
is inconsistent with moral agency, nay, with rationality
itself, and all the ends and purposes of our being.—Our
author describes the natural ridicule of vice in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Measure</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Measure</span></span>
in the strongest terms, where, after having
made the angels weep over the vices of men, he adds,
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with</span></em> our spleens <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">they might laugh themselves quite
mortal</span></span>. Indeed if we had a perfect discernment of the
ends of this life only, and could preserve ourselves from
sympathy, disgust, and terror, the vices of mankind would
be a source of perpetual entertainment. The great
difference between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heraclitus</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Democritus</span></span> lay, it seems,
in their spleen only;—for a wise and good man must
either laugh or cry without ceasing. Nor indeed is it
easy to conceive (to instance in one case only) a more
laughable, or a more melancholy object, than a human
being, his nature and duration considered, earnestly and
anxiously exchanging peace of mind and conscious integrity
for gold; and for gold too, which he has often no
occasion for, or dares not employ:—But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voltaire</span></span> has by
one Publication rendered all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arguments</span></em> superfluous: He
has told us, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Candide</span></span>, the merriest and most diverting
tale of frauds, murders, massacres, rapes, rapine,
desolation, and destruction, that I think it possible on any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other plan to invent; and he has given us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motive</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effect</span></em>, with every possible aggravation, to improve the
sport. One would think it difficult to preserve the point
of ridicule, in such a case, unabated by contrary emotions;
but now that the feat is performed it appears of easy
imitation, and I am amazed that our race of imitators have
made no efforts in this sort: It would answer I should
think in the way of profit, not to mention the moral uses
to which it might be applied. The managements of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voltaire</span></span> consists in this, that he assumes a gay, easy, and
light tone himself; that he never excites the reflections of
his readers by making any of his own; that he hurries us
on with such a rapidity of narration as prevents our
emotions from resting on any particular point; and to
gain this end, he has interwoven the conclusion of one
fact so into the commencement of another, that we find
ourselves engaged in new matter before we are sensible
that we had finished the old; he has likewise made
his crimes so enormous, that we do not sadden on any
sympathy, or find ourselves partakers in the guilt.—But
what is truly singular as to this book, is, that it does not
appear to have been written for any moral purpose, but
for That only (if I do not err) of satyrising Providence
itself; a design so enormously profane, that it may well
pass for the most ridiculous part of the whole composition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if vice, divested of disgust and terror, is thus in its
own nature ridiculous, we ought not to be surprized if the
very same vices which spread horror and desolation thro'
the Tragic scene should yet furnish the Comic with its
highest laughter and delight, and that tears, and mirth,
and even humour and wit itself, should grow from the
same root of incongruity: For what is humour in the
humourist, but incongruity, whether of sentiment, conduct,
or manners? What in the man of humour, but a
quick discernment and keen sensibility of these incongruities?
And what is wit itself, without presuming
however to give a complete definition where so many have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
failed, but a talent, for the most part, of marking with
force and vivacity unexpected points of likeness in things
supposed incongruous, and points of incongruity in
things supposed alike: And hence it is that wit and
humour, tho' always distinguished, are so often coupled
together; it being very possible, I suppose, to be a man
of humour without wit; but I think not a man of wit
without humour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I have here raised so much new matter, that the
reader may be out of hope of seeing this argument, any
more than the tale of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tristram</span></span>, brought to a conclusion:
He may suppose me now prepared to turn my pen to a
moral, or to a dramatic Essay, or ready to draw the line
between vice and virtue, or Comedy and Tragedy, as
fancy shall lead the way;—But he is happily mistaken; I
am pressing earnestly, and not without some impatience,
to a conclusion. The principles I have now opened
are necessary to be considered for the purpose of estimating
the character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, considered as relatively to
human nature: I shall then reduce him with all possible
dispatch to his Theatric condition, and restore him, I
hope, without injury, to the stage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is indeed a vein or two of argument running
through the matter that now surrounds me, which I
might open for my own more peculiar purposes; but
which, having resisted much greater temptations, I shall
wholly desert. It ought not, however, to be forgotten,
that if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has used arts to abate our respect of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, it should follow by just inference, that, without
such arts, his character would have grown into a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respect</span></em> inconsistent
with laughter; and that yet, without Courage,
he could not have been respectable at all;—that it required
nothing less than the union of ability and Courage to
support his other more accidental qualities with any tolerable
coherence. Courage and Ability are first principles of
Character, and not to be destroyed whilst the united frame
of body and mind continues whole and unimpaired; they
are the pillars on which he stands firm in spight of all his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vices and disgraces;—but if we should take Courage
away, and reckon Cowardice among his other defects, all
the intelligence and wit in the world could not support
him through a single Play.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The effect of taking away the influence of this quality
upon the manners of a character, tho' the quality and the
influence be assumed only, is evident in the cases of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parolles</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bobadil</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parolles</span></span>, at least, did not seem to want wit;
but both these characters are reduced almost to non-entity,
and, after their disgraces, walk only thro' a scene or two,
the mere mockery of their former existence. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parolles</span></span> was
so changed, that neither the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fool</span></em>,
nor the old lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le-feu</span></span>,
could readily recollect his person; and his wit seemed to
be annihilated with his Courage.

Let it not be here objected that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is universally
considered as a Coward;—we do indeed call him so; but
that is nothing, if the character itself does not act from any
consciousness of this kind, and if our Feelings take his
part, and revolt against our understanding.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the arts by which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has contrived to
obscure the vices of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, they are such as, being subservient
only to the mirth of the Play, I do not feel
myself obliged to detail.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it may be well worth our curiosity to inquire into
the composition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character.—Every man we
may observe has two characters; that is, every man may
be seen externally, and from without;—or a section may
be made of him, and he may be illuminated from within.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the external character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, we can scarcely be
said to have any steady view. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jack Falstaff</span></span> we are familiar
with, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir John</span></span> was
better known, it seems, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to the rest of
Europe</span></span>, than to his intimate companions; yet we have so
many glimpses of him, and he is opened to us occasionally
in such various points of view, that we cannot be mistaken
in describing him as a man of birth and fashion, bred
up in all the learning and accomplishments of the times;—of
ability and Courage equal to any situation, and capable
by nature of the highest affairs; trained to arms, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
possessing the tone, the deportment, and the manners of
a gentleman;—but yet these accomplishments and advantages
seem to hang loose on him, and to be worn with
a slovenly carelessness and inattention: A too great indulgence
of the qualities of humour and wit seems to draw him
too much one way, and to destroy the grace and orderly
arrangement of his other accomplishments;—and hence he
becomes strongly marked for one advantage, to the injury,
and almost forgetfulness in the beholder, of all the rest.
Some of his vices likewise strike through, and stain his
Exterior;—his modes of speech betray a certain licentiousness
of mind; and that high Aristocratic tone which
belonged to his situation was pushed on, and aggravated
into unfeeling insolence and oppression. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It is not a
confirmed brow</span></span>,”</span> says the Chief Justice, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nor the throng of
words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from
you, can thrust me from a level consideration</span></span>”</span>:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">My lord</span></span>,”</span>
answers <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you call honourable boldness impudent
sauciness. If a man will court'sie and say nothing, he is
virtuous: No, my lord, my humble duty remembered, I will
not be your suitor. I say to you I desire deliverance from
these officers, being upon hasty employment in the King's
affairs.</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You speak</span></span>,”</span>
replies the Chief Justice, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as
having power to do wrong.</span></span>”</span>—His whole behaviour to the
Chief Justice, whom he despairs of winning by flattery, is
singularly insolent; and the reader will remember many
instances of his insolence to others: Nor are his manners
always free from the taint of vulgar society;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">This is
the right fencing grace, my lord</span></span>,”</span> says he to the Chief
Justice, with great impropriety of manners, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tap for tap,
and so part fair</span></span>”</span>:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Now the lord lighten thee,</span></span>”</span> is the
reflection of the Chief Justice, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thou
art a very great fool.</span></span>”</span>—Such
a character as I have here described, strengthened
with that vigour, force, and alacrity of mind, of which he
is possessed, must have spread terror and dismay thro' the
ignorant, the timid, the modest, and the weak: Yet is he
however, when occasion requires, capable of much accommodation
and flattery;—and in order to obtain the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
protection and patronage of the great, so convenient to
his vices and his poverty, he was put under the daily
necessity of practising and improving these arts; a baseness
which he compensates to himself, like other unprincipled
men, by an increase of insolence towards his
inferiors.—There is also a natural activity about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>
which, for want of proper employment, shews itself in
a kind of swell or bustle, which seems to correspond with
his bulk, as if his mind had inflated his body, and
demanded a habitation of no less circumference: Thus
conditioned he rolls (in the language of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ossian</span></span>) like a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Whale of Ocean</span></span>, scattering the smaller fry; but affording,
in his turn, noble contention to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hal</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>; who, to
keep up the allusion, I may be allowed on this occasion
to compare to the Thresher and the Sword-fish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s character, many things which
he does and says, and which appear unaccountably
natural, are to be referred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are next to see him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from within</span></em>: And here we
shall behold him most villainously unprincipled and
debauched; possessing indeed the same Courage and
ability, yet stained with numerous vices, unsuited not only
to his primary qualities, but to his age, corpulency, rank,
and profession;—reduced by these vices to a state of
dependence, yet resolutely bent to indulge them at any
price. These vices have been already enumerated; they
are many, and become still more intolerable by an excess
of unfeeling insolence on one hand, and of base accommodation
on the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what then, after all, is become of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">old Jack</span></span>? Is this
the jovial delightful companion—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, the favourite and
the boast of the Stage?—by no means. But it is, I think
however, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> of Nature; the very stuff out of
which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stage Falstaff</span></span> is composed; nor was it possible,
I believe, out of any other materials he could have been
formed. From this disagreeable draught we shall be able,
I trust, by a proper disposition of light and shade, and
from the influence of compression of external things,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to produce <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">plump Jack</span></span>, the life of humour, the spirit
of pleasantry, and the soul of mirth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this end, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> must no longer be considered as a
single independent character, but grouped, as we find him
shewn to us in the Play;—his ability must be disgraced
by buffoonery, and his Courage by circumstances of
imputation; and those qualities be thereupon reduced
into subjects of mirth and laughter:—His vices must be
concealed at each end from vicious design and evil effect,
and must thereupon be turned into incongruities, and
assume the name of humour only;—his insolence must be
repressed by the superior tone of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hal</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>, and
take the softer name of spirit only, or alacrity of
mind;—his state of dependence, his temper of accommodation,
and his activity, must fall in precisely with
the indulgence of his humours; that is, he must
thrive best and flatter most, by being extravagantly
incongruous; and his own tendency, impelled by so much
activity, will carry him with perfect ease and freedom to
all the necessary excesses. But why, it may be asked,
should incongruities recommend <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> to the favour of
the Prince?—Because the Prince is supposed to possess a
high relish of humour and to have a temper and a force
about him, which, whatever was his pursuit, delighted in
excess. This, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is supposed perfectly to comprehend;
and thereupon not only to indulge himself in all kinds of
incongruity, but to lend out his own superior wit and
humour against himself, and to heighten the ridicule by
all the tricks and arts of buffoonery for which his corpulence,
his age, and situation, furnish such excellent
materials. This compleats the Dramatic character of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, and gives him that appearance of perfect good-nature,
pleasantry, mellowness, and hilarity of mind, for
which we admire and almost love him, tho' we feel certain
reserves which forbid our going that length; the true
reason of which is, that there will be always found a
difference between mere appearances and reality: Nor are
we, nor can we be, insensible that whenever the action of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
external influence upon him is in whole or in part relaxed,
the character restores itself proportionably to its more
unpleasing condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A character really possessing the qualities which are on
the stage imputed to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, would be best shewn by its
own natural energy; the least compression would disorder
it, and make us feel for it all the pain of sympathy:
It is the artificial condition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> which is the source
of our delight; we enjoy his distresses, we <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gird at him</span></span>
ourselves, and urge the sport without the least alloy of
compassion; and we give him, when the laugh is over,
undeserved credit for the pleasure we enjoyed. If any one
thinks that these observations are the effect of too much
refinement, and that there was in truth more of chance in
the case than of management or design, let him try his
own luck;—perhaps he may draw out of the wheel of
fortune a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span>, an
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Othello</span></span>, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Benedict</span></span>,
or a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such, I think, is the true character of this extraordinary
buffoon; and from hence we may discern for what special
purposes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has given him talents and qualities,
which were to be afterwards obscured, and perverted to
ends opposite to their nature; it was clearly to furnish
out a Stage buffoon of a peculiar sort; a kind of Game-bull
which would stand the baiting thro' a hundred Plays,
and produce equal sport, whether he is pinned down
occasionally by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hal</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Poins</span></span>, or tosses such mongrils as
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bardolph</span></span>, or the Justices, sprawling in the air. There is in
truth no such thing as totally demolishing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>; he has
so much of the invulnerable in his frame that no ridicule
can destroy him; he is safe even in defeat, and seems to
rise, like another <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antæus</span></span>, with recruited vigour from every
fall; in this, as in every other respect, unlike <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parolles</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bobadil</span></span>: They fall by the first shaft of ridicule, but
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> is a butt on which we may empty the whole quiver,
whilst the substance of his character remains unimpaired.
His ill habits, and the accidents of age and corpulence, are
no part of his essential constitution; they come forward
indeed on our eye, and solicit our notice, but they are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
second natures, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>; mere shadows, we pursue them
in vain; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> himself has a distinct and separate subsistence;
he laughs at the chace, and when the sport
is over, gathers them with unruffled feather under his
wing: And hence it is that he is made to undergo not
one detection only, but a series of detections; that he is
not formed for one Play only, but was intended originally
at least for two; and the author, we are told, was doubtful
if he should not extend him yet farther, and engage
him in the wars with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span>. This he might well have
done, for there is nothing perishable in the nature of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>: He might have involved him, by the vicious
part of his character, in new difficulties and unlucky
situations, and have enabled him, by the better part, to
have scrambled through, abiding and retorting the jests
and laughter of every beholder.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But whatever we may be told concerning the intention
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> to extend this character farther, there is a
manifest preparation near the end of the second part of
Henry IV. for his disgrace: The disguise is taken off, and
he begins openly to pander to the excesses of the Prince,
intitling himself to the character afterwards given him of
being <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the tutor and the
feeder of his riots</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I will fetch off</span></span>,”</span>
says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">these Justices.—I will devise matter enough out of
this </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Shallow</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> to keep the Prince in continual laughter the
wearing out of six fashions.—If the
young </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">dace</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> be a bait for
the old </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">pike</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">,</span></span>”</span> (speaking with reference to his own
designs upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>)
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I see no reason in the law of nature
but I may snap at him.</span></span>”</span>—This is shewing himself abominably
dissolute: The laborious arts of fraud, which he
practises on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span> to induce the loan of a thousand
pound, create <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disgust</span></em>; and the more, as we are sensible
this money was never likely to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paid back</span></em>, as we are
told that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>, of which the travellers had been robbed.
It is true we feel no pain for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>, he being a very bad
character, as would fully appear, if he were unfolded; but
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s deliberation in fraud is not on that account more
excusable.—The event of the old King's death draws him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out almost into detestation.—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Robert Shallow</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">,
chuse what office thou wilt in the land,—'tis thine.—I am
fortune's steward.—Let us take any man's horses.—The laws
of England are at my commandment.—Happy are they who
have been my friends;—and woe to my </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Lord Chief
Justice</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">.</span></span>”</span>—After this we ought not to complain if we
see Poetic justice duly executed upon him, and that he is
finally given up to shame and dishonour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is remarkable that, during this process, we are
not acquainted with the success of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>'s designs upon
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span> 'till the moment
of his disgrace. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">If I had had
time</span></span>,”</span> says he to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shallow</span></span>, as the King is approaching,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed the
thousand pounds I borrowed of you</span></span>”</span>;—and the first word
he utters after this period is, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Shallow</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, I owe you a
thousand pounds</span></span>”</span>: We may from hence very reasonably
presume, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> meant to connect this fraud with
the punishment of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>, as a more avowed ground of
censure and dishonour: Nor ought the consideration that
this passage contains the most exquisite comic humour and
propriety in another view, to diminish the truth of this
observation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But however just it might be to demolish <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> in
this way, by opening to us his bad principles, it was by no
means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">convenient</span></em>. If we had been to have seen a single
representation of him only, it might have been proper
enough; but as he was to be shewn from night to night,
and from age to age, the disgust arising from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">close</span></em>
would by degrees have spread itself over the whole
character; reference would be had throughout to his bad
principles, and he would have become less acceptable as he
was more known: And yet it was necessary to bring him,
like all other stage characters, to some conclusion. Every
play must be wound up by some event, which may shut
in the characters and the action. If some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hero</span></em> obtains a
crown, or a mistress, involving therein the fortune of
others, we are satisfied;—we do not desire to be afterwards
admitted of his council, or his bed-chamber: Or if
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through jealousy, causeless or well founded, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> kills a
beloved wife, and himself after,—there is no more to be
said;—they are dead, and there an end; Or if in the
scenes of Comedy, parties are engaged, and plots formed,
for the furthering or preventing the completion of that
great article Cuckoldom, we expect to be satisfied in the
point as far as the nature of so nice a case will permit, or
at least to see such a manifest <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disposition</span></em> as will leave us in
no doubt of the event. By the bye, I cannot but think
that the Comic writers of the last age treated this matter
as of more importance, and made more bustle about it,
than the temper of the present times will well bear; and
it is therefore to be hoped that the Dramatic authors of
the present day, some of whom, to the best of my judgment,
are deserving of great praise, will consider and treat
this business, rather as a common and natural incident
arising out of modern manners, than as worthy to be held
forth as the great object and sole end of the Play.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But whatever be the question, or whatever the character,
the curtain must not only be dropt before the eyes, but
over the minds of the spectators, and nothing left for
further examination and curiosity.—But how was this to
be done in regard to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>? He was not involved in
the fortune of the Play; he was engaged in no action
which, as to him, was to be compleated; he had reference
to no system, he was attracted to no center; he passes
thro' the Play as a lawless meteor, and we wish to know
what course he is afterwards likely to take: He is
detected and disgraced, it is true; but he lives by detection,
and thrives on disgrace; and we are desirous to see
him detected and disgraced again. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fleet</span></em> might be no
bad scene of further amusement;—he carries <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> within
him, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and what matter</span></em> where, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if he be still the same</span></em>, possessing
the same force of mind, the same wit, and the same
incongruity. This, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> was fully sensible of, and
knew that this character could not be compleatly dismissed
but by death.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Our author,”</span> says the Epilogue
to the Second Part of Henry IV., <span class="tei tei-q">“will continue the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
story with Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span> in it, and make you merry with fair
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catherine</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span>; where, for any thing I know,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> shall dye of a sweat, unless already he be killed
with your hard opinions.”</span> If it had been prudent in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> to have
killed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span> with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hard opinion</span></em>, he had
the means in his hand to effect it;—but dye, it seems, he
must, in one form or another, and a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sweat</span></em> would have been
no unsuitable catastrophe. However we have reason to be
satisfied as it is;—his death was worthy of his birth and of
his life: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He was born</span></span>,”</span>
he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">about three o'clock in the
afternoon, with a white head, and something a round belly.</span></span>”</span>
But if he came into the world in the evening with these
marks of age, he departs out of it in the morning in all the
follies and vanities of youth;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He was shaked</span></span>”</span> (we are
told) <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of a burning quotidian tertian;—the young King had
run bad humours on the knight;—his heart was fracted and
corroborate; and a' parted just between twelve and one, even

tradition that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Merry Wives</span></span> was
written at the command of Elizabeth had been recorded already by
Dennis in the preface to his version of the
play,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Comical Gallant,
or the Amours of Sir John Falstaffe</span></span> (1702): <span class="tei tei-q">“This Comedy was written
at her command, and by her direction, and she was so eager to see it
acted, that she commanded it to be finished in fourteen days; and was
afterwards, as Tradition tells us, very well pleas'd at the Representation.”</span>
Cf. Dennis's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Defence of a Regulated Stage</span></span>:
<span class="tei tei-q">“she not only commanded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this part of Falstaff.</span></span> Rowe is here indebted apparently to the
account of John Fastolfe in Fuller's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Worthies of England</span></span> (1662). But
neither in it, nor in the similar passage on Oldcastle in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Church

Cent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">xv.</span></span>, p. 168), does Fuller say that
the name was altered at the command of the queen, on objection being
made by Oldcastle's descendants. This may have been a tradition at
Rowe's time, as there was then apparently no printed authority for it,
but, as Halliwell-Phillips showed in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Character of Sir John Falstaff</span></span>,
1841, it is confirmed by a manuscript of about 1625, preserved in the
Bodleian. Cf. also Halliwell-Phillips's

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In a conversation</span></span>, etc. The authority for this conversation is
Dryden, who had recorded it as early as 1668 in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay of Dramatic
Poesy</span></span>, at the conclusion of the magnificent eulogy of Shakespeare. He
had also spoken of it to Charles Gildon, who, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Reflections on Mr.
Rymer's Short View of Tragedy</span></span> (1694), had given it with greater fulness
of detail. Each of the three accounts contains certain particulars
lacking in the other two, but they have unmistakably a common source.
Dryden probably told the story to Rowe, as he had already told it to
Gildon. The chief difficulty is the source, not of Rowe's information,
but of Dryden's. As Jonson was present at the discussion, it must
have taken place by 1637. It is such a discussion as prompted Suckling's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Session of the Poets</span></span> (1637), wherein Hales
and Falkland figure. It cannot
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Centurie of Prayse</span></span>, pp. 198-9).
The Lord Falkland mentioned in Gildon's account is undoubtedly the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> lord, who succeeded in 1633, and died in 1643. Dryden may
have got his information from Davenant.

lawyers, and the acts and statutes of our Parliaments; and by the same

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a href="#Pg052" class="tei tei-ref">52</a>. Pope's references to the early
editions of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Merry Wives</span></span> and
other plays do not prove his assertions. Though an imperfect edition
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Merry Wives</span></span> appeared
in 1602, it does not follow that this was
<span class="tei tei-q">“entirely new writ”</span> and transformed into the play in the Folio of 1623.
The same criticism applies to what he says
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry V.</span></span>, of which pirated
copies appeared in 1600, 1602, and 1608. And he is apparently under
the impression that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Contention
of York and Lancaster</span></span> and the early
play of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> were Shakespeare's own work.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">those Poems which pass for his.</span></span> The seventh or supplementary
volume of Rowe's and Pope's editions contained, in addition to some
poems by Marlowe, translations of Ovid by Thomas Heywood. Like
Rowe, Pope has some doubt as to the authorship of the poems, but on
the score of the dedications he attributes
to him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Venus and Adonis</span></span> and
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rape of Lucrece</span></span>. Both
editors ignored the Sonnets. It is doubtful
how far Shakespeare was indebted to Ovid in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Venus and Adonis</span></span>.
He knew Golding's translation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metamorphoses</span></span> (1565-67); but
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Venus and Adonis</span></span> has many
points in common with Lodge's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scillaes
Metamorphosis</span></span> which appeared in 1589. See, however, J. P. Reardon's
paper in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Shakespeare Society's Papers,”</span> 1847, iii. 143-6, where it
is held that Lodge is indebted to Shakespeare.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautus.</span></span> Cf. Rowe, p. 9. Gildon had claimed for Shakespeare
greater acquaintance with the Ancients than Rowe had admitted, and
Pope had both opinions in view when he wrote the present passage.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I think there are many arguments to prove,”</span> says Gildon, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he
knew at least some of the Latin poets, particularly Ovid; two of his
Epistles being translated by him: His motto to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Venus and Adonis</span></span> is
another proof. But that he had read Plautus himself, is plain from his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedy of Errors</span></span>, which
is taken visibly from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menæchmi</span></span> of that
poet.... The characters he has in his plays drawn of the Romans
is a proof that he was acquainted with their historians.... I contend
not here to prove that he was a perfect master of either the Latin or
Greek authors; but all that I aim at, is to shew that as he was capable
of reading some of the Romans, so he had actually read Ovid and
Plautus, without spoiling or confining his fancy or genius”</span> (1710, p. vi).

the notes to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Odyssey</span></span> were written by Broome. He had cast aside

grand Shakespeare, <span class="tei tei-q">‘un senateur romain fasse le bouffon, et qu'un roi
paraisse sur le théâtre en ivrogne.’</span> Je ne veux point soupçonner le
sieur Johnson d'être un mauvais plaisant, et d'aimer trop le vin; mais je
trouve un peu extraordinaire qu'il compte la bouffonnerie et l'ivrognerie
parmi les beautés du théâtre tragique; la raison qu'il en donne n'est
pas moins singulière. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Le poète, dit il, dédaigne ces distinctions accidentelles
de conditions et de pays, comme un peintre qui, content

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not published by the author.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Every writer on Shakespeare hath
expressed his astonishment that his author was not solicitous to secure
his fame by a correct edition of his performances. This matter
is not understood. When a poet was connected with a particular
playhouse, he constantly sold his works to
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Company</span></span>, and it was their
interest to keep them from a number of rivals. A favourite piece, as
Heywood informs us, only got into print when it was copied <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by the ear</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘for a double sale would bring on a suspicion of honestie.’</span> Shakespeare
therefore himself published nothing in the drama: when he left the
stage, his copies remained with his fellow-managers, Heminge and
Condell; who at their own retirement, about seven years after the
death of their author, gave the world the edition now known by the
name of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">first Folio</span></span>, and call the previous publications
<span class="tei tei-q">‘stolne and surreptitious, maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of
injurious impostors.’</span> But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> was printed from the playhouse copies;
which in a series of years had been frequently altered, thro' convenience,
caprice, or ignorance. We have a sufficient instance of the
liberties taken by the actors, in an old pamphlet by Nash, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lenten
Stuff, with the Prayse of the red Herring</span></span>, 4to, 1599, where he assures us
that in a play of his, called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isle
of Dogs</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">foure acts</span></span>, without his
consent, or the least guesse of his drift or scope, were supplied by the
players.’</span>—This, however, was not his first quarrel with them. In the
Epistle prefixed to Greene's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arcadia</span></span>,
which I have quoted before, Tom
hath a lash at some <span class="tei tei-q">‘vaine glorious tragedians,’</span> and very plainly at
Shakespeare in particular; which will serve for an answer to an observation
of Mr. Pope, that had almost been forgotten: <span class="tei tei-q">‘It was thought a
praise to Shakespeare that he scarce ever blotted a line. I believe the
common opinion of his want of learning proceeded from no better
ground. This, too, might be thought a praise by some.’</span> But hear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Nash, who was far from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">praising</span></em>: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I leaue all these to the mercy of their
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother-tongue</span></em>, that feed on nought but the crums that fall from the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">translator's</span></em> trencher,—that could scarcely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latinize</span></em>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlets</span></span>, I should say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">handfuls</span></em> of tragicall

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle</span></span> was first published;
but, I fancy, it will carry the original <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span>
somewhat further back than we have hitherto done; and it may be
observed that the oldest copy now extant is said to be <span class="tei tei-q">‘enlarged to
almost as much againe as it was.’</span> Gabriel Harvey printed at the end
of the year 1592 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Foure Letters
and certaine Sonnetts, especially touching
Robert Greene</span></span>: in one of which his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arcadia</span></span> is mentioned. Now Nash's
Epistle must have been previous to these, as Gabriel is quoted in it with
applause; and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Foure
Letters</span></span> were the beginning of a quarrel. Nash
replied in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Strange Newes of

Verses, as they were going</span></span> privilie
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to victual the Low Countries</span></span>, 1593.

were on the stage before his time, and that he was employed by the
Players only to refit and repair; taking due care to retain the names
of the characters and to preserve all those incidents which were the
most popular. Some of these Plays, particularly the two parts of
Hen. IV., have certainly received what may be called a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thorough repair</span></span>;

which I have here censured (Hen. VI.) we see very little of the new. I
should conceive it would not be very difficult to feel one's way thro'
these Plays, and distinguish every where the metal from the clay. Of
the two Plays of Hen. IV. there has been, I have admitted, a complete
transmutation, preserving the old forms; but in the others, there is
often no union or coalescence of parts, nor are any of them equal in
merit to those Plays more peculiarly and emphatically
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">own</span></em>.
The reader will be pleased to think that I do not reckon into
the works of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> certain absurd productions which his
editors have been so good as to compliment him with. I object, and
strenuously too, even to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span></span>; not that it wants
merit, but that it does not bear the peculiar features and stamp of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rhyming parts of the Historic plays are all, I think, of an older
date than the times of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>.—There was a Play, I
believe, of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Acts of King John</span></span>, of which the bastard
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falconbridge</span></span> seems to have
been the hero and the fool: He appears to have spoken altogether in
rhyme. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> shews him to us in the latter part of the second
scene in the first act of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King John</span></span> in this condition; tho' he
afterwards, in the course of the Play, thought fit to adopt him, to give him language
and manners, and to make him his own.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_44" name="note_44" href="#noteref_44">44.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader must be sensible of something in the
composition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s characters, which renders
them essentially different from
those drawn by other writers. The characters of every Drama must
indeed be grouped; but in the groupes of other poets the parts which
are not seen do not in fact exist. But there is a certain roundness
and integrity in the forms of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, which give them an
independence as well as a relation, insomuch that we often meet with
passages which, tho' perfectly felt, cannot be sufficiently explained in
words, without unfolding the whole character of the speaker: And this
I may be obliged to do in respect to that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lancaster</span></span>, in order
to account for some words spoken by him in censure of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Falstaff</span></span>.—Something
which may be thought too heavy for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">text</span></em>,
I shall add <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">here</span></em>, as a conjecture concerning the
composition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>'s characters:
Not that they were the effect, I believe, so much of a minute and
laborious attention, as of a certain comprehensive energy of mind,
involving within itself all the effects of system and of labour.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bodies of all kinds, whether of metals, plants, or animals, are supposed
to possess certain first principles of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>, and to have an existence
independent of the accidents which form their magnitude or growth:
Those accidents are supposed to be drawn in from the surrounding
elements, but not indiscriminately; each plant and each animal imbibes
those things only which are proper to its own distinct nature, and
which have besides such a secret relation to each other as to be capable
of forming a perfect union and coalescence: But so variously are the
surrounding elements mingled and disposed, that each particular body,
even of those under the same species, has yet some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar</span></em> of its own.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> appears to have considered the being and growth of the
human mind as analogous to this system: There are certain qualities
and capacities which he seems to have considered as first principles; the
chief of which are certain energies of courage and activity, according to
their degrees; together with different degrees and sorts of sensibilities,
and a capacity, varying likewise in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">degree</span></em>, of discernment and intelligence.
The rest of the composition is drawn in from an atmosphere
of surrounding things; that is, from the various influences of the
different laws, religions and governments in the world; and from those
of the different ranks and inequalities in society; and from the different
professions of men, encouraging or repressing passions of particular sorts,
and inducing different modes of thinking and habits of life; and he
seems to have known intuitively what those influences in particular
were which this or that original constitution would most freely imbibe
and which would most easily associate and coalesce. But all these
things being, in different situations, very differently disposed, and those
differences exactly discerned by him, he found no difficulty in marking
every individual, even among characters of the same sort, with something
peculiar and distinct.—Climate and complexion demand their influence;
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, and love thee
after</span></span>,”</span> is a sentiment characteristic of, and fit only to be
uttered by a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moor</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it was not enough for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> to have formed his characters
with the most perfect truth and coherence; it was further necessary
that he should possess a wonderful facility of compressing, as it were,
his own spirit into these images, and of giving alternate animation to
the forms. This was not to be done <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from without</span></em>; he must have
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em> every varied situation, and have spoken thro' the organ he had
formed. Such an intuitive comprehension of things and such a
facility must unite to produce a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>. The reader will not
now be surprised if I affirm that those characters in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span>, which
are seen only in part, are yet capable of being unfolded and understood
in the whole; every part being in fact relative, and inferring
all the rest. It is true that the point of action or sentiment, which
we are most concerned in, is always held out for our special notice.
But who does not perceive that there is a peculiarity about it, which
conveys a relish of the whole? And very frequently, when no particular
point presses, he boldly makes a character act and speak from those
parts of the composition which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inferred</span></em> only, and not distinctly shewn.
This produces a wonderful effect; it seems to carry us beyond the
poet to nature itself, and gives an integrity and truth to facts and
character, which they could not otherwise obtain: And this is in
reality that art in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> which, being withdrawn from our
notice, we more emphatically call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>. A felt propriety and truth from
causes unseen, I take to be the highest point of Poetic composition.
If the characters of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> are thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em>, and as it were original,
while those of almost all other writers are mere imitation, it may
be fit to consider them rather as Historic than Dramatic beings;
and, when occasion requires, to account for their conduct from the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em> of character, from general principles, from latent motives, and
from policies not avowed.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_45" name="note_45" href="#noteref_45">45.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These observations
have brought me so near to the regions of
Poetic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magic</span></em> (using the word here in its strict and proper sense, and
not loosely as in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">text</span></em>), that, tho' they lie not directly in my course,
I yet may be allowed in this place to point the reader that way.
A felt propriety, or truth of art, from an unseen, tho' supposed adequate
cause, we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>. A like feeling of propriety and truth, supposed
without a cause, or as seeming to be derived from causes inadequate,
fantastic, and absurd,—such as wands, circles, incantations, and so
forth,—we call by the general name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magic</span></em>, including all the train
of superstition, witches, ghosts, fairies, and the rest.—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Reason</span></em> is
confined to the line of visible existence; our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passions</span></em> and our
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fancy</span></em> extend far beyond into the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">obscure</span></em>; but however
lawless their operations may seem, the images they so wildly form have yet a relation
to truth, and are the shadows at least, however fantastic, of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em>. I am not
investigating but passing this subject, and must therefore leave behind
me much curious speculation. Of Personifications however we should
observe that those which are made out of abstract ideas are the
creatures of the Understanding only: Thus, of the mixed modes,
virtue, beauty, wisdom and others,—what are they but very obscure
ideas of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualities</span></em> considered as abstracted from any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject</span></em>
whatever? The mind cannot steadily contemplate such an abstraction: What
then does it do?—Invent or imagine a subject in order to support
these qualities; and hence we get the Nymphs or Goddesses of
virtue, of beauty, or of wisdom; the very obscurity of the ideas
being the cause of their conversion into sensible objects, with
precision both of feature and of form. But as reason has its personifications,
so has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passion</span></em>.—Every passion has its Object, tho' often
distant and obscure;—to be brought nearer then, and rendered
more distinct, it is personified; and Fancy fantastically decks, or
aggravates the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>, and adds <span class="tei tei-q">“a local
habitation and a name.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But passion is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dupe</span></em> of its own artifice and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">realises</span></em>
the image it had formed. The Grecian theology was mixed of both these
kinds of personification. Of the images produced by passion it
must be observed that they are the images, for the most part, not
of the passions themselves, but of their remote effects. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Guilt</span></em> looks
through the medium, and beholds a devil; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fear</span></em>, spectres of every
sort; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hope</span></em>, a smiling cherub; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">malice</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">envy</span></em>
see hags, and witches, and inchanters dire; whilst the innocent and the young behold
with fearful delight the tripping fairy, whose shadowy form the
moon gilds with its softest beams.—Extravagant as all this appears,
it has its laws so precise that we are sensible both of a local and
temporary and of an universal magic; the first derived from the
general nature of the human mind, influenced by particular habits,
institutions, and climate; and the latter from the same general
nature abstracted from those considerations: Of the first sort the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">machinery</span></em> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span>
is a very striking instance; a machinery, which,
however exquisite at the time, has already lost more than half its
force; and the Gallery now laughs in some places where it ought to
shudder:—But the magic of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempest</span></span> is lasting and
universal.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is besides a species of writing for which we have no
term of art, and which holds a middle place between nature and
magic; I mean where fancy either alone, or mingled with reason,
or reason assuming the appearance of fancy, governs some real
existence; but the whole of this art is pourtrayed in a single
Play; in the real madness of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lear</span></span>, in the assumed wildness of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edgar</span></span>, and in the Professional <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fantasque</span></span>
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fool</span></span>, all operating
to contrast and heighten each other. There is yet another feat in
this kind, which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shakespeare</span></span> has
performed;—he has personified <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">malice</span></em> in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Caliban</span></span>; a character kneaded up of three distinct
natures, the diabolical, the human, and the brute. The rest of
his preternatural beings are images of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effects</span></em> only, and cannot
subsist but in a surrounding atmosphere of those passions from
which they are derived. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Caliban</span></span> is
the passion itself, or rather a
compound of malice, servility, and lust, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantiated</span></em>; and therefore
best shewn in contrast with the lightness of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ariel</span></span> and the innocence
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miranda</span></span>.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Witches</span></span>
are sometimes substantial existences, supposed
to be possessed by, or allyed to the unsubstantial: but the Witches
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span> are a gross sort of shadows,
<span class="tei tei-q">“bubbles of the earth,”</span>
as they are finely called by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banquo</span></span>.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ghosts</span></span> differ from other
imaginery beings in this, that they belong to no element, have
no specific nature or character, and are effects, however harsh the
expression, supposed without a cause; the reason of which is that
they are not the creation of the poet, but the servile copies or
transcripts of popular imagination, connected with supposed reality
and religion. Should the poet assign the true cause, and call them
the mere painting or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">coinage of the brain</span></span>, he would disappoint his
own end, and destroy the being he had raised. Should he assign
fictitious causes, and add a specific nature, and a local habitation,
it would not be endured; or the effect would be lost by the
conversion of one being into another. The approach to reality in
this case defeats all the arts and managements of fiction.—The whole
play of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempest</span></span> is of so high
and superior a nature that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dryden</span></span>,

who affects gaiety under the pressure of severe misfortunes; but

            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
